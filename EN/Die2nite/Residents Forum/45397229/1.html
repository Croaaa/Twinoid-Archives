                <p>i just wanted to start this in a new thread so i will still be able to edit the first post and at some point it will be moved to the wiki...</p><p><strong><em>here are some informations discovered so far about Souls and shaman in season 11:<br></em></strong><br><strong>How does the Shaman get selected?</strong></p><ul><li>in each new town the shaman get selected on Day 2. and each time the current shaman dies the next day a new shaman will be selected as the new shaman. this also means each town can only have one shaman at all times. <br>its 100% random, we tried to find any kind of connection to who may get selected (twice after having the first shaman suicide) according to activity, first to log in on previous day or current day, lowest and highest activity, hero or resident, all of this had nothing to do with who got selected a new shaman.</li></ul><p><strong>What are The Forms a Soul can take:</strong><br>each time a town has a death, a Blue Lost Soul gets generated outside in the Desert:</p><ul><li><strong><em>Blue Lost Souls</em></strong>: if someone dies <strong><em>Inside or Outside</em></strong> the town as a watchmen, dehydration, Infection, withdrawl, Poison, Eaten by zeds in town, camping outside or not camping at all, ALL those types of deaths will Generate a Blue <strong><em>Lost Soul</em></strong> in the desert next day. (Death by Poison or cyanide immediately generate a new lost souls in the same day of the death) <br>It is completely safe for anyone of any class shaman or not to pick up this types of souls without any need for an immunity from Mystic potions. they are harmless when picked up.</li><li><strong><em>Red Tortured Souls</em></strong>: this Form only appear in the game after a Blue Lost Soul transform over night into a Tortured Soul.<br>If a Blue Lost Soul is left outside in the desert for at least one day then there is a chance that the lost Soul WILL transform into a Red <strong><em>Tortured Soul</em></strong> <a target="_blank" href="http://embed.gyazo.com/3367e94b6fa751fe833742fc234e304f.png">Tortured Souls look like this </a> <br>this Form of Souls will kill the citizen which will attempt to pick them up immediately as if it was a poison AS LONG THE SOULS ARE OUTSIDE!!!<br>BUT there are 2 Ways to avoid this death by either<ul><li>letting the shaman pick them up which will be immune to their effect because of the shamanic power, OR</li><li>letting any non-shaman citizen Drink a so called Mystic Potion or Shamanic Potion which can be made by the shaman in his home using 1 Soul Action and 1 water <a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/ce115d94bf5a86bc85e8be01f5e0a3e4.png">like this</a> and the person drinking it will become immune for <strong><em>the entire length of that town (not just 1 day) and allow him/her to pick any tortured Soul safely from that point on forward.</em></strong> here is the message you get after Drinking the <a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/4e37b99f0884c8e1babb00aa45706ece.png"> Mystic Potion</a> and here is the message you get when you successfully pick up a tortured Soul while being immune <a target="_blank" href="http://embed.gyazo.com/bb585008efd6fa6ccf396e5e679ff17f.png">here Picking up a red tortured Soul</a><br>THEN once the red tortured Soul is collected and put in the bank Anyone in town <a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/4efcae029314b93f446bc19985c22d52.png">can touch the Red Tortured Soul in town from bank safely WITHOUT the need for drinking a Mystic Potion.</a> Red Tortured Souls are only dangerous to pick up outside!!!</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Why does each town get a shaman and what can this Skill/class Do and why it is one of the most important Job in each town?</strong></p><ul><li>A Shaman can see all souls regardless of their current FORM at all times even after they have been picked up and dropped again . they will be hovering in a square of 4 zones, and the Soul will always be in the lower right zone of that square. the shaman can see the souls under unvisited zones so it is no longer needed to open the entire map by walking through all zones as it was the case in previous seasons.<br><a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/cd72cfe349d3523118c3a7a8fdb40aec.png">shaman can see the souls under unvisited zones</a></li></ul><p><strong>Once the shaman gets selected on day 2 he/she will have a daily <a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/c9e65c5f9c4c0d37571428e657ce08ac.png">5 Soul Action Points</a> and here is what the shaman can do with them:</strong></p><ul><li><a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/b3a69ce4217b79a97fc6bf8e5b1134ff.png">Making it Rain</a> : to either kill zeds or if used at the town´s Gates it has a 50% chance (confirmed form a small data base for now) to add 5 water to the well. and this action costs 3 Soul Action Points which means it can be done only once daily.</li><li><a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/ce115d94bf5a86bc85e8be01f5e0a3e4.png">Brew a Shamanic Potion</a> this requires 1 Soul Action Point and 1 water and it can be done up to 5 times daily. as explained before this potion must be drank as a replacement for daily water when a non-shaman needs to pick up and collect a red tortured Soul to avoid immediate death and become immune for <strong><em>the entire length of that town (not just 1 day)</em></strong>. and a reminder if you drink this Mystic Potion you will regain 6 normal AP and refreshed status , BUT at the cost of no longer being able to drink water again to regain another 6 AP. so its a simple exact replacement for water except giving the bonus of immunity against tortured Souls.</li><li>shaman can pick up tortured Souls without any risk for death or the need to drink a mystic Potion and they are the only person in each town that can carry several souls of any form at once in their rucksacks. <a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/afc8e81e39014c4c11dadd409b0cd5e1.png">a shaman carrying 2 souls at once in rucksack</a> , as you can see one of the souls is tortured and the other one is lost soul. And here you can see that <a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/cf572fda1c73825cdff431b4d4178e98.png">Non-shaman classes still as before can not carry 2 souls at once</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/38b33a287bc0e9d89f916e2437a4196f.png">Healing illness and other statuses</a> , it can fail or succeed and sometimes the illness gets transformed to the shaman. not very interesting for testing since it has small chances to succeed to cure only (terror, infection and injuries) , it CAN NOT cure dehydration or being hooked.</li></ul><p><strong>What are the effects of NOT purifying and having/leaving a tortured soul outside in the desert over night or Inside in the bank, someone´s Chest or someone´s Rucksack?</strong></p><ul><li><strong><em>leaving one or several Red Tortured Souls outside or inside in Bank, Chests , or Rucksacks WILL increase the size of the attack by X = 15% for each red tortured Soul left Not Purified over night</em></strong>. it will be visible by an increased change of all attack estimation numbers of the 30% to 100% and it will increase both with the X factor of the size of the actual attack which we usually have as if no souls were outside:<br><strong><em>this factor is confirmed to be X = 15% of the actual size of the attack.</em></strong><br>so to make it simple in an example: if you have an attack size of 100 zombies (best estimation here, not maximum estimation) and you leave one red tortured Soul Not Purified before the attack then your attack size will automatically become 115 which is 100 + 15% of the 100.<br>and if you leave 2 red Tortured souls Not Purified the attack size will increase from 100 to 130, if you leave 10 red souls Not Purified the attack will increase to 150% to go from 100 to 250.</li></ul><p><strong>Will the 15% increase of the attack size for each Tortured Soul outside or inside disappear after Purifying those Souls on the same Day?</strong></p><ul><li>NO, this penalty will remain in the same day you purify them and you will have to defend both the attack size of lets say Day X and the 15% penalty added to it. and this penalty will only disappear on the next day Day (X + 1) <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_arma.gif" alt=":hordes_arma:" class="tid_ico"> this is considered a BUG because it makes no sense and its completely unfair (it has been reported and hopefully the Devs will look into it and be kind to make the penalty disappear immediately after purifying the red souls)<img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_arma.gif" alt=":hordes_arma:" class="tid_ico"></li></ul><p><strong>What are the effects of NOT purifying Blue Lost Souls before the attack by leaving them OUTSIDE in the desert or INSIDE the town in Bank , someone´s rucksack, someone´s Chest over night?</strong></p><ul><li>if you Do Not purify Blue Lost Soul before each attack which looks like <a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/c3f620fc41e648281c1096ced7cbdb00.png">This</a> then they Will have a chance to transform into a Red Tortured wherever they are. (<strong><em>there is a Bug that if the lost Soul transform while it is in the bank then a new red Tortured Soul will be added to the Bank BUT the old Blue Lost Soul which transformed will not not be replaced by the new Soul or disappear and it will remain in bank creating a Phantom Soul as i find it fit to call them) (<img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_arma.gif" alt=":hordes_arma:" class="tid_ico"> this was reported and i am sure it will be soon fixed by the Devs <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_arma.gif" alt=":hordes_arma:" class="tid_ico">)</em></strong><br>to avoid this Transformation all you need to do is simply Purify all Blue Lost Soul which get generated in your town no matter where they are outside or inside. <br>you will have the option to Purify Souls from anyone´s Home After you build the project called <strong><em>Hammam</em></strong> by clicking at the "Purify the Soul" which will give you a pointless message like <a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/710fca838b5615da77b60e40e3df75fa.png">This</a>. <br>this used to give towns 10 ranking points per soul in previous seasons, but not anymore this season.</li></ul><p><strong>What happens when making someone pick a red tortured soul while in escort without that person drinking a mystic potion?</strong></p><ul><li>While <a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/ef2aaa13f4c84ea53e914ae3acec3f6c.png">on escort</a> It <a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/2a683cade9d343d9f661ba748712ac6c.png">will kill that person</a><br>here the red soul will immediately disappear and it WILL NOT generate a new soul next day!</li></ul>

                <p>This explains why my town's (hc) attack estimate was already in the range of 400-1200 on day 5, last I saw it before going out anyway (estimate wasn't final). So it looks like the effect does stack, or at least it does in hardcore or it adds more to the max estimate than it does to the min. There is that specific mention under season changes for hc towns to "NEVER" leave tortured souls outside.</p><p>So can purifying a tortured soul also be done by anyone in their house at any time, assuming they had the mystic potion that day? Do you need the Hammam built for any purifying as the guide says, or is that building there just to gain possible ranking points? Can shaman make it rain outside or in a zone with zombies?</p>

                <p>HC town update: we went into chaos after the last attack (day 5), which turned out to be near the minimum (497) even though the estimate range was huge. Our incommunicado shaman died, <a target="_blank" href="http://cdn.meme.am/instances/500x/61122068.jpg">so...</a></p><p>I can also confirm that souls can be seen floating across the whole map, including the unexplored parts. I tried making it rain in a zone with 4 zombies and of course as per before (apart from costing 3/5 shamanic points instead of ap+soul):<br><span class="tid_sideNote">You perform a shamanic dance and plead to the sky to bring rain to cleanse this zone of evil spirits, but nothing happens. Admittedly, for anyone watching, you looked like the worst kind of amateur. To add insult to injury, you've given yourself blisters on your feet...</span></p><p>What I'm curious about now is can a tech be a shaman and have both shaman &amp; construction points or is there a glitch with those since they now function similarly. In my last hc town where I was the only person remaining, I stayed as only a tech and not a shaman. This was a season switchover town so anything is possible, though we did have a resident shaman earlier on.</p><p>Currently I'm a scavenger shaman, under the status field a voodoo mask appears where my shovel would be, though my searches are 90mins and I can see adjacent zones' depletion status, so I'm both.</p>

                <p>That makes random towns even more difficult due to attacks doubling or worse as of day 2 (caused by many outside deaths on day 1 which instantly generate tortured souls come day 2). It's true that random towns normally don't last long anyway and soon the breach is limited by lack of citizens/lazy zombies, but a few random towns that do manage to pull together and organise somewhat in the later days will now become nonexistent. These occasional "good" towns are, in my opinion, what keeps a lot of random players coming back for more.</p><p>Having to befriend a random player (shaman) to make the town work sounds like a good idea, but collecting far away souls and having the whole town incur a large penalty if not collected/shaman being inactive is literally overkill.</p><p>I'd also like to add that the shaman healing bug remains, as in you cannot remove any effects from a person that is wounded and will receive an automatic fail message while still using up 2 shaman points.</p>

What made it funny to me is that not only was she lucky the first soul was not tortured, she had it in her rucksack when trying to pickup the tortured one and survived. Which would also mean that the action of attempting to pick it up does not kill you, but the action of it landing in your rucksack does.</p><p><strong>BUT</strong> as it turns out <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_wink.gif" alt=":hordes_wink:" class="tid_ico">, shaman did make a potion since I left the town which she took and did not realise functioned as a ration, which messed up her ap, so this picking up of a tortured soul while carrying a lost one without a potion is still to be tested <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_lol.gif" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>We got the shaman assigned on day 2 and he died outside the same day trying to collect 3 souls.

This makes sense if going by Fortis' theory, so even if old shaman did die in some other way (other than being eaten in town), a new shaman is elected after the attack (23:00) but before the breach (say 23:02).</p><p>This would explain not having a shaman when being the lone survivor or risk not having one whenever there is a breach.</p><p>If the above does not make sense, let me try with an example of what it looks like to me:<br><em>Shaman check &amp; assignment occurs at 23:00 each day, either the existing one survives and remains the shaman or a new one is assigned out of the remaining survivors. THEN the breach occurs (if any) at 23:02 and if that old or newly assigned shaman gets eaten, you won't have one until tomorrow, unless that one gets eaten too.</em></p>

                <p>ok thanks for the data:<br>clearly my assumption was wrong and there were no broken lost souls inside the town durig attack.<br>the exact same thing happend to us when we (distant map) brought a broken lost soul back in town but never repaired it before the attack which lead to the 15% increase which wasn´t even visible in the attack estimation.</p><p>sadly it has been confirmed that having inside deaths (dehydration which is similar to withdrawl because it happens PRIOR to attack) never generated a red soul outside in our distant map. AND having an outside death DID generate a new red soul BUT that red soul DID NOT interfer with the attack size till 24 hours after it was generated . <br>IN Your case there is 2 options:</p><ul><li>lets say that inside Withdrawl death generated a red souls then that red soul would only aftect the attack size after 24 hours not immediately. the other option:</li><li>lets say that inside withdrawl death generated a broken lost Soul. then the only way for that new Blue Soul to effect the attack size if it somehow ended up inside the town and not in the desert prior to attack but shortly after it got generated.</li></ul><p>all of this somehow make it look like the rules for souls in HC are either diffrent or in reverse compared to distant.</p><p><strong><em>to figure this out we need to have a test in a distant map with 1 withdrawl suicide volunteer while the shaman is still alive that day AND the town covering 15% extra over the attack size to see what that 1 Soul will do and to see if the shaman can locate where it landed and in which form it will has</em></strong></p>

THIS Logicaly (but yet not 100% confirmed) means that your red tortured soul on day 7 is a replacment soul for the person which did not get eaten. it has been confirmed that withdrawl did leave a soul after the update so NOW i think the victum death eaten by a ghoul also now leaves a soul (after the update). and since the change came after the update your town got the red soul added to the bank and not outside , possibly as aone time thing in the transmition towns only.</p><p>about your day 9 red soul in bank i have no clue , it doesn´t make any sense at all.</p><p>we in our town got broken lost souls OUTSIDE and not in bank from all kinds of deaths (watchmen, outside, campers failing to survive, terminal dehydration)</p><br><p>some other unrelated confirmation</p><ul><li><a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/b9d4194f1b1c42dae8276228202755be.png">Souls NOW can land in the south</a> , (before the update they only landed in the North)</li></ul>

                <p>sorry that it took me over 40 days to get the chance to update the first post with the changed we got from the mid season bug fixes and changes. was too busy in a serious jump but its finally over and we got to even discover one important change during that jump so the wait was´t bad in the end</p><p>but since i ran into few people who where on a break or random towns who got directed to this thread i felt the need to update it since many of the infos in first post were completely incorrect due to the mid season changes we did´t get a chance to test</p><p>BUT now i think everything to know about Souls and shaman is finally updated and confirmed in the first post and i will post it in the next post as well so all will notice the changes which can be deal breakers if not dealt with as explained in here.</p><p>feel free to point out anything i missed or maybe i possibly got wrong.</p>

(Death by Poison or cyanide immediately generate a new lost souls in the same day of the death) <br>It is completely safe for anyone of any class shaman or not to pick up this types of souls without any need for an immunity from Mystic potions. they are harmless when picked up.</li><li><strong><em>Red Tortured Souls</em></strong>: this Form only appear in the game after a Blue Lost Soul transform over night into a Tortured Soul.<br>If a Blue Lost Soul is left outside in the desert for at least one day then there is a chance that the lost Soul WILL transform into a Red <strong><em>Tortured Soul</em></strong> <a target="_blank" href="http://embed.gyazo.com/3367e94b6fa751fe833742fc234e304f.png">Tortured Souls look like this </a> <br>this Form of Souls will kill the citizen which will attempt to pick them up immediately as if it was a poison AS LONG THE SOULS ARE OUTSIDE!!!<br>BUT there are 2 Ways to avoid this death by either<ul><li>letting the shaman pick them up which will be immune to their effect because of the shamanic power, OR</li><li>letting any non-shaman citizen Drink a so called Mystic Potion or Shamanic Potion which can be made by the shaman in his home using 1 Soul Action and 1 water <a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/ce115d94bf5a86bc85e8be01f5e0a3e4.png">like this</a> and the person drinking it will become immune for <strong><em>the entire length of that town (not just 1 day) (we still need to test this since it may have been changed after the mid season update)</em></strong> and allow him/her to pick any tortured Soul safely. here is the message you get after Drinking the <a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/4e37b99f0884c8e1babb00aa45706ece.png"> Mystic Potion</a> and here is the message you get when you successfuly pick up a tortured Soul while being immune <a target="_blank" href="http://embed.gyazo.com/bb585008efd6fa6ccf396e5e679ff17f.png">here Picking up a red tortured Soul</a><br>THEN once the red tortured Soul is collected and put in the bank Anyone in town <a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/4efcae029314b93f446bc19985c22d52.png">can touch the Red Tortured Soul in town from bank safely WITHOUT the need for drinking a Mystic Potion.</a> Red Tortured Souls are only dangerous to pick up outside!!!</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Why does each town get a shaman and what can this Skill/class Do and why it is one of the most important Job in each town?</strong></p><ul><li>A Shaman can see all souls regardless of their current FORM at all times even after they have been picked up and dropped again . they will be hovering in a square of 4 zones, and the Soul will always be in the lower right zone of that square. the shaman can see the souls under unvisited zones so it is no longer needed to open the entire map by walking through all zones as it was the case in previous seasons.<br><a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/cd72cfe349d3523118c3a7a8fdb40aec.png">shaman can see the souls under unvisited zones</a></li></ul><p><strong>Once the shaman gets selected on day 2 he/she will have a daily <a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/c9e65c5f9c4c0d37571428e657ce08ac.png">5 Soul Action Points</a> and here is what the shaman can do with them:</strong></p><ul><li><a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/b3a69ce4217b79a97fc6bf8e5b1134ff.png">Making it Rain</a> : to either kill zeds or if used at the town´s Gates it has a 50% chance (confirmed form a small data base for now) to add 5 water to the well. and this action costs 3 Soul Action Points which means it can be done only once daily.</li><li><a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/ce115d94bf5a86bc85e8be01f5e0a3e4.png">Brew a Shamanic Potion</a> this requires 1 Soul Action Point and 1 water and it can be done up to 5 times daily. as explained before this potion must be drank as a replacement for daily water when a non-shaman needs to pick up and collect a red tortured Soul to avoid immediate death and become immune for <strong><em>the entire length of that town (not just 1 day) (needs confirming after mid season change)</em></strong>. and a reminder if you drink this Mystic Potion you will regain 6 normal AP and refreshed status , BUT at the cost of no longer being able to drink water again to regain another 6 AP. so its a simple exact replacement for water except giving the bonus of immunity against tortured Souls.</li><li>shaman can pick up tortured Souls without any risk for death or the need to drink a mystic Potion and they are the only person in each town that can carry several souls of any form at once in their rucksacks. <a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/afc8e81e39014c4c11dadd409b0cd5e1.png">a shaman carrying 2 souls at once in rucksack</a> , as you can see one of the souls is tortured and the other one is lost soul. And here you can see that <a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/cf572fda1c73825cdff431b4d4178e98.png">Non-shaman classes still as before can not carry 2 souls at once</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/38b33a287bc0e9d89f916e2437a4196f.png">Healing illness and other statuses</a> , it can fail or succeed and sometimes the illness gets transformed to the shaman. not very interesting for testing since it has small chances to succeed to cure only (terror, infection and injuries) , it CAN NOT cure dehydration or being hooked.</li></ul><p><strong>What are the effects of NOT purifying and having/leaving a tortured soul outside in the desert over night or Inside in the bank, someone´s Chest or someone´s Rucksack?</strong></p><ul><li><strong><em>leaving one or several Red Tortured Souls outside or inside in Bank, Chests , or Rucksacks WILL increase the size of the attack by X = 15% for each red tortured Soul left Not Purified over night</em></strong>. it will be visible by an increased change of all attack estimation numbers of the 30% to 100% and it will increase both with the X factor of the size of the actual attack which we usually have as if no souls were outside:<br><strong><em>this factor is confirmed to be X = 15% of the actual size of the attack.</em></strong><br>so to make it simple in an example: if you have an attack size of 100 zombies (best estimation here, not maximum estimation) and you leave one red tortured Soul Not Purified before the attack then your attack size will automatically become 115 which is 100 + 15% of the 100.<br>and if you leave 2 red Tortured souls Not Purified the attack size will increase from 100 to 130, if you leave 10 red souls Not Purified the attack will increase to 150% to go from 100 to 250.</li></ul><p><strong>Will the 15% increase of the attack size for each Tortured Soul outside or inside disappear after Purifying those Souls on the same Day?</strong></p><ul><li>NO, this penalty will remain in the same day you purify them and you will have to defend both the attack size of lets say Day X and the 15% penalty added to it. and this penalaty will only disappear on the next day Day (X + 1) <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_arma.gif" alt=":hordes_arma:" class="tid_ico"> this is considered a BUG because it makes no sense and its completely unfair (it has been reported and hopefully the Devs will look into it and be kind to make the penalty disappear immediately after purifying the red souls)<img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_arma.gif" alt=":hordes_arma:" class="tid_ico"></li></ul><p><strong>What are the effects of NOT purifying Blue Lost Souls before the attack by leaving them OUTSIDE in the desert or INSIDE the town in Bank , someone´s rucksack, someone´s Chest over night?</strong></p><ul><li>if you Do Not purify Blue Lost Soul before each attack which looks like <a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/c3f620fc41e648281c1096ced7cbdb00.png">This</a> then they Will have a chance to transform into a Red Tortured wherever they are. (<strong><em>there is a Bug that if the lost Soul transform while it is in the bank then a new red Tortured Soul will be added to the Bank BUT the old Blue Lost Soul which transformed will not not be replaced by the new Soul or disappear and it will remain in bank creating a Phantom Soul as i find it fit to call them) (<img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_arma.gif" alt=":hordes_arma:" class="tid_ico"> this was reported and i am sure it will be soon fixed by the Devs <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_arma.gif" alt=":hordes_arma:" class="tid_ico">)</em></strong><br>to avoid this Transformation all you need to do is simply Purify all Blue Lost Soul which get generated in your town no matter where they are outside or inside. <br>you will have the option to Purify Souls from anyone´s Home After you build the project called <strong><em>Hammam</em></strong> by clicking at the "Purify the Soul" which will give you a pointless message like <a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/710fca838b5615da77b60e40e3df75fa.png">This</a>. <br>this used to give towns 10 ranking points per soul in previous seasons, but not anymore this season.</li></ul><p><strong>What happens when making someone pick a red tortured soul while in escort without that person drinking a mystic potion?</strong></p><ul><li>While <a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/ef2aaa13f4c84ea53e914ae3acec3f6c.png">on escort</a> It <a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/2a683cade9d343d9f661ba748712ac6c.png">will kill that person</a><br>here the red soul will immediately disappear and it WILL NOT generate a new soul next day!</li></ul>

                <p>I have to say, I'm deeply saddened by the presence of Souls in this game, now. It's a stupid difficulty spike in the learning curve for this game, and essentially limits games to at maximum about a week in length. A small town map lasts about 7 to 8 days, and a distant town map lasts about as much because sometimes souls are more than 15 AP away from town and there are no resources to spare to get them.</p><p>Just wanted to vent my frustration with this stupid mechanic, it makes me mad that now you have to waste so much effort to rid yourself of the shit-tons of people who die outside day 1 because they don't log back in. It punishes people who actually play so much more, it makes me honestly unmotivated to continue playing this game...</p>

                <p>I would definitely agree that they should remove souls from small maps, just like you can't camp in small maps because it is too difficult.</p><p>I think they should go back to the old system with souls. In distant and HC maps both the old and new systems mainly benefited the metas but at least with the old system the randoms weren't punished with them.</p>

(food, twinoid/steroid, alcohol and if the Soul is turtured after being left outside for 48 hours then you need to replace the drinking water with drinking a mystic potion to gain immunity). and with the last few slots open in rucksack you fill rest with as many flash Granades or Grisly Bombs in case the scout loses camouflage.<br>and keep in mind that no one can carry 2 souls at once in rucksack except one person in each town which is the shaman. (except tamers who can send one soul with their dog back home then carry a second soul back home)</li></ul><ul><li>second strategy is for the Team to build a zoo by locking a group of zeds between 2 walls of the map and kill every last zed outside that box. by then you can send anyone of any profession to collect the souls and walk back home without any need to carry weapons or flash granades...<br>(could be half zoo by killing all zeds in one half of the map and locking rest in the other half and keep them from getting outside that half daily) then you need scouts for one half (the red half) for collecting souls and anyone can collect in the other half (the Green half)</li></ul><p>ALL THAT SAID: Souls didnt come in season 11 to stay , so wouldn´t get too much used to them. they are only an obstacle to overcome which hopefully will get less difficult in new seasons to come...</p>
