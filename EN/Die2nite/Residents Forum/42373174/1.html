                <p>Hello I thought I would start another thread on writing for fun. Here is mine!</p><p><br><br>They gathered in the center of town waiting for her. Colette walked through the group of approximately 40 and stepped up on the makeshift podium of pallets and plywood. She looked over the sea of faces raised to her and tried to make brief eye contact with as many as she could. She cleared her throat. Her voice was gravelly. <br>"Last night we were attacked again. The walls held. Today we will walk the perimeter on the outside and fortify them again. Every night the horde grows bigger. Tonight we can expect a significant breech."<br>A murmur of fearful acknowledgment swept through the crowd. <br>Colette paused until all eyes were on her again. <br>She thought, they all thought, that coming to this place, this abandoned town and building a fortress would deter the horde. That they would be left alone. But since the first sentry had made his way to the walls the horde continued to multiple each night.</p><p>Their only tools were makeshift weapons. Heavy appliances, no longer functional in this post apocalyptic world. Daggers and machetes, and other weapons only useful for close combat.</p><p>"Everyone will need to be on watch again tonight" <br>"What about the prisoners?" Someone asked from the crowd.</p><p>Colette knew it was a fair question. Every night if any of the hordes made it through the gates or over the walls, they were taken prisoner. They could be used as bargaining chips with the horde. Sometimes they were freed if the horde left. Sometimes they were freed with notes to let the horde know they weren't cruel monsters. That they would fight if it became a necessity. Only wanting to be left alone.</p><p>The townspeople referred to their enclosure as "the zoo".</p><p>And the zoo was filled with small tents and fire pits. For the prisoners comfort. Everyday they were provided with meat. Not human meat. But any domesticated animals or strays they found. The townspeople shared with the prisoners. And, of course, any vegetables they managed to scrap up.</p><p>Because the prisoners were treated decently and fed and watered they grew more comfortable in their zoo. Sometimes you could even hear low laughter from among them. That was cut off abruptly when a guard turned towards them.</p><p>Colette knew the prisoners listened to the morning meetings. <br>So her answer to “what about the prisoners?” was coached for those that listened as well as to her own people. <br>"I think the time is almost near to use them as a barter"</p><br><p>That afternoon the daily meat that was given to the prisoners was laced with N677 and a slight sedative. When they had finished their afternoon meal most of the prisoners were sleeping. A few realizing what was happening roared in anger. Or helplessness. It was easy to then move among them all and give them a shot of N800.</p><p>The dose in the meat, N677 was the vaccine/virus that was given to <br>most of the population before the apocalypse. Touted as the new vaccine to combat a virulent strain of deadly flu. It was made mandatory for the whole country to have the shot.</p><p>When the "Flu" symptoms appeared anyway the hospitals and clinics were inundated with people thinking they were dying. The symptoms included vision changes, a sharp increase in night vision, decreased heart rate in spite of dangerously high temperatures, increased thirst and on their torso the appearance of big carbuncle type sores, only seen in late stages with HIV patients.</p><p>The cure? Another government mandated drug endorsed and distributed by the Center For Communicable Disease Control, N800. Most people took the N800. <br>Except the groups of people that sweated the N677 vaccine/virus out and survived. These were people that usually refused vaccines and most were vegetarians or Vegans. Most had figured out the "cure" was worst than the disease. <br>Like addicts surfacing after withdrawals. They survived.</p><p>Those that trusted the government and convinced by the CCDC took the N800, and within hours became less a person, more a modified mass of tissue and functioning organs. Their heart rate slowed even more. The improved vision stayed. They still had cohesive, coherent thought. As a matter of fact, their brainwaves were extraordinary. Almost all alpha waves. These are calming waves of the brain that most people only have short bursts of. However, most of the survivors were horrified of the needs their body demanded. Such as an overwhelming hunger for meat. And over time learned that any meats satisfied their hunger. Whole families had to learn a different way to survive. A different way to live and love. A different way to measure self control.</p><p>Because the people that survived the flu were envied to the point of hate, some of the newly modified humans with diminished mentality in their life before these supposedly inoculations and in this new state of being saw them as food. Food on the hoof. The survivors had to learn to cope. They banded up with other survivors and moved away from urban areas. Some hid, built new towns and handpicked their town members. Like a coalition. <br>Others, out of fear and ignorance became a group of dedicated hunters. Their motto? residui sumus "we are survivors. Over time, their fanaticism became obsession.</p><p>So Colette decided to do the only thing she could. In defense of their new town they needed more soldiers.</p><p>Along with several of the towns people, Colette stood at the fence surrounding the zoo. This would be a difficult night. <br>She waited until they awoke early that evening. The last sleep they would ever need. The sun was slowly descending in the sky. They could see each other clearly though. She waited. Until they looked at each other. Until their faces filled with realization of this new horror. They were paler, the areas below their eyes darker, if they looked closer they would see the skin on their faces seemed to droop a little as if it had lost some muscle tone. She looked over the sea of new faces. Men and women clutching each other. A few scattered children. Making small whimpering sounds. Colette was betting on their will to live....</p><p>She said in her gravelly post apocalyptic voice. <br>"You are now among the hunted. You can stand with us or you can take your chances alone outside the wall. As you must know, there is no cure for "zombies" You have no place to go now. You will be hunted down like the animals people think your are. But you are welcome here. You will be treated with dignity no matter your choice. You are still you. As you have seen while here, we respect each other. And eat food of our choice. We are not animals. <br> <br>She tried to make eye contact with as many as possible. Looking into their newly glittering eyes. Trying to reassure them without words that this new way of being, of living, was not so terrible. That they no longer had to live a life of a nomad. They were home. <br>Almost all met her eyes for the first time since being taken prisoner.</p><p>Colette unlocked the gate to the zoo and stepped back. Not one of the newly turned made an attempt to leave the town or ran for the gate.. They stepped out of the zoo as free people. A new understanding in their eyes.</p>

                <p>Ok...here it is. I actually wrote this right after I said I would write you a story...but for some reason couldnt post it!</p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">Disclaimer. I know I used a mythical hero, a god, immortal death squads, gunslinger, cats, and talking ravens in this mish mash. But in my defense it made me laugh.</span></p><br><p>Dark The Raven</p><p>Odin the great is immortal. His curiosity has led him to travel the world and he has seen sights untold. The beauties of the world that generally goes unnoticed by the mortals that inhabit this wonderful place. Each season Mother Nature in all her glory drapes herself in the jewels of nature. Just looking makes his soul ache. And he has witnessed the devastation man can wreck on not only Gods bounty but on themselves. He has been called by many names. Raven King, Dark Lord....Dark The Raven is the one that seems to stick the longest. Immortality means he usually walks alone. Yet, he has two fellow travelers. To call them "pets" insults both Odin and his companions. <br>Two large ravens.</p><p>When the ravens chose to wander with him, Huginn and Muninn were given several gifts by Odin. The ability to speak and the ability to see as well as Odin at night. Huginn was also given the special gift of thought. The insight to see and understand motivations. Muninn's gift was the ability of mind. The insight to see the ramifications of things that could and could not be changed. At night both ravens leave Odin and roam the world. This in itself was another gift given the 2 ravens. Birds have notoriously bad night vision but Odin’s gift gave them a whole new world to explore. Huginn and Muninn soared and rode the wild wind currents. It satisfied their souls.</p><p>A lot of ravens in the 13th century had simple needs, Survival, food, mating. Some aspired to be picked to join the elite death squads. If accepted they would be scouts and seekers, and like the other creatures that were part of the Death Squads. Immortal. <br>These were men/demons/creatures wearing black hooded cloaks, riding soot black horses with huge black dogs loping beside them.</p><p>They rove in packs of 12. Their hoods covered their heads and kept their faces hidden in deep shadow.</p><p>Their intentions were to punish the wicked. Abolish the unnatural.</p><p>They rode almost without sound. Only the creak of the saddles, the hooves of the horses. The dogs did not bay until a prey was in sight. The horses did not whinny or snort. They all knew their missions were to meet and conquer death.</p><p>To see a Death Squad riding meant death was near. Rare was the man or woman that lived to tell of seeing one ride by. In years past people knew that if they heard a squad close by they were to lie down and cover their ears. They squeezed their eyes closed and fervently whispered prayers. Any prayers would do. As long as the litany drowned out the creaks of saddles and the light pounding of hooves. To peek was to draw their attention. And simple people that wanted to live simple lives hid their faces so they could live to tell the tale of how close death had touched them.</p><p>After a time the tales of the Death Squads became lore. Generations passed and they were not seen. Or rather, there was no one that lived to tell the tale of seeing them.</p><p>Odin, The Dark Raven, was in a town he stumbled across a week before. He had just arrived in the country and was intrigued when he heard of the uprising of the undead. <br>It was a desert shantytown with heavily fortified gates. During this era Odin dressed as a gunslinger. His pistols low and tied to his thighs. His pockets full of precious bullets. It amused him to play at being human. Even an out of date one. The townspeople although leery of him, welcomed him in. He listened with interest to the stories of fighting for their lives from these "zombies" His companions; Huginn and Muninn remained perched close by. Heads cocked and listening. After a light meal of stew, Odin settled down. He asked his companions to scout that night to see how bad it really was. Assuming the townspeople had exaggerated quite a bit.</p><p>At about 1 am he awoke to the sounds of shuffling and moaning on the other side of the wall. Although fear was foreign to him, the sound gave him almost a visceral feeling. He needed to see the creatures that made such hungry sounds.</p><p>He scaled the wall and looked down at the mass of rotting corpses before him, 1000s of them! <br>He had heard of similar creatures when he was a young God. The undead had killed millions. It crossed continents. It was genocide for some races. But the Death Squads had rode at night to abolish the hordes! He thought this might equal that hellish time. The flutter of wings beside him was a relief. He climbed back down to ground level and leaning his back against the wall listened as his companions said the hordes outside the walls were everywhere. Surrounding all camped villagers.</p><p>He apologized to his bird friends but requested another errand of them. He wanted them to call on the Death Squads.</p><p>The town was quietly jubilant the next morning. No deaths.</p><p>Odin, although new to the town had a suggestion. <br>He asked the townspeople to remain in their tents that night. He indicated he had asked for help and they needed reassurance that they were not observed. The townspeople looked confused but agreed.</p><p>That night at midnight Odin again climbed the wall. His companions again soon settled beside him. They returned with the news they had made contact with 3 death squads. Although not one had verbally agreed to help they would make their decision known.<br>The Death Squad rarely spoke. And then in only riddles.</p><p>The zombies pushed on the barricaded walls. Odin could feel the wall shake. The moaning and animalistic chatter below him took on an almost gleeful tone. Odin began to second-guess his decision to send the townspeople to bed</p><p>Huginn cawed. He stared out in to the stillness beyond the mass of inhumanity below the wall on which they clung.</p><p>Odin saw the dark shapes racing towards the town. He also saw 2 more sets racing from other directions. The relief he felt that the Death Squads were coming to help these people in the buttressed walls was an almost primitive emotion.</p><p>The riders along with the black dogs as big as horses themselves began tearing into the zombies. The Death Squads scimitars rose and fell. It did not seem the undead felt pain. There were no screams or even efforts to defend themselves, which should be an instinctive human thing to do. But yet again, a sign of the zombies inhumanity.</p><p>Odin stayed on the wall and bore witness. These were loving breathing people at one time. Someone needed to mourn them, even as they suffered an inhumane death.</p><p>Once the last zombie fell. A lone rider rode to the wall Odin perched on. The rider raised his face and Odin saw only a white chin. A gravely voice that sounded as if he had swallowed broken glass spoke in the tongue of the lost language of the ancient Norse German.</p><p>"This pestilence that has scoured this country will soon be over. The living will see many more dead before that day. The toll will be heavy. We will ride every night until then"</p><p>Odin bowed his head in respect. So did his companions.</p><p>The man/creature continued. <br>"Don't make a mouse of yourself, or else you will be eaten by cats."</p><p>Odin frowned slightly. What did he mean?</p><p>Odin replied. <br>"It is too much to expect of a cat that he should sit by the milk and not lap it?"</p><p>The reply was even more confusing. <br>"There are more ways of killing a cat than choking it with cream."</p><p>Once again Odin replied<br>"To catch rats the cats take off their gloves"</p><p>The man bowed his hooded head in honor. He turned his horse and rode away with his squad following.</p><p>Odin climbed down the wall. Not on the inside but on the outer wall.</p><p>He walked over and around the dead. He headed out into the desert.</p><p>The next morning the townspeople awoke to the site of the undead bodies. And to the newcomer, Odin, missing.</p><p>Thus began another legendary tale of Odin's strength and courage. Killing a 1000 undead single-handedly. Then mysteriously disappearing as he had mysteriously appeared.</p><p>Meanwhile the Death Squads rode nightly. Saving mankind when they couldn't save themselves. Until the world was once again cleansed. By abolishing the unnatural creatures man had made.</p>

                <p>it's an old one of mine but its worth a new audience:</p><p>I call it "rebirth"<br>The only pain worse than death is rebirth.<br>Rebirth isn’t even an appropriate name for The Event. You are no babe, there are no children. Only adults eaten alive than mysteriously reconstituted. No one has seen The Event from outside their own eyes. <br>One moment you are fighting to keep the life you have when the soft teeth finally tear your flesh from your bones, your nerve endings on fire as you panic and fight harder as those teeth multiply and fingers pull at you. They always seem to find your navel, digging into the grip and pulling it wide, another cold finger pulls the other way and you hyperventilate feeling your body stretch and rip, if you're lucky you can’t see. But when was the last time you knew luck? <br>But that is just a stub of the toe compared to when your soul bolts from that body. You notice it’s joints stiffen and twitch and whatever is left of it stands as your consciousness sears across the globe. <br>A silent scream is held in your eternal self.<br>A thousand simultaneous pains too intense for any body to contain is your experience. You know it will be over soon, you have done this a dozen times before but the pain never callosses. <br>At last, The Event. Forcibly your identity is thrust into a husk and your new body awakens. As familiar as the last. As familiar as the next. Fresh, hot air fills your lungs at once and exits loudly. Tears stream from your new eyes onto your new cheeks and a black crow perches on an old post.<br>“Why?” You whisper to the crow, the same crow you’ve seen dozens of times with its distinctive white feather on the tip of its wing. “Again?” <br>The crow caws at you and flies toward the north and you see the town. Always a town. <br>As you near the town you see silhouettes in the horizon. Your new neighbors have arrived. <br>40 crows caw as one from the town walls and fly out into the wastes. <br>Whispers greet you from the inhabitants. Complaining of The Event and of some familiar faces. Some hold each other quietly as you walk to an empty plot and claim it as your own. And you see her.<br>You’ve never seen her before, her hair is tangled in knots and her eyes are all brown her pupils are like pinholes and she climbs.<br>She climbs over the sobs of the others.<br>She climbs over the fights of past lives done wrong.<br>She climbs past the finite water and the limited resources. She climbs over all our struggles to dodge The Event one more day. <br>And more literally she climbs on top of the heap that will soon be a workshop and she screams.<br>A long sustained wail ripples past her cheeks and she robs everyones attention. You know what happens next, you’ve seen if a few times before, looking around you figure most the folks here have not seen it before. <br>As her siren wears out she takes a breath and a crow flies back perched on the ridge of our gates. She points to the crow and shouts at us “what is he doing here?! Always following and always watching!” She throws a rock at the bird. At least you assume that is where she was aiming for the rock hit the gate at least 10 feet below the bird. He stares and blinks. <br>“He witness’s both ends of The Event” An audible gasp circulates the masses, The Event is rarely spoken of and only in hushed wimpers. Even you furrow your brow. And another onyx fiend flies in to join it’s brother. “He knows why we are here! DO YOU?!”<br>Her arms outspread she pauses and waits for suggestion. <br>“Cell phones!” A cry from a corner offers and she spits. <br>“Microwave ovens!” She laughs with contempt for that idea. Shadows quickly pass over her as more birds join at the wall. <br>“We have all heard those fancy and convenient stories before I’ll wager I’ve heard them longer then most of you!” Everyones ears were hers as she lowered her voice to slightly more than a whisper. “But what is the truth, why do we become zombies” She laughs a crackled laugh followed with coughing “Zombies?! Really? Zombies were for movies and books in our previous days, before this nightmare begun” <br>Forgetting yourself, you stand up angry at her suddenly. You open your mouth to shout but someone beats you to it “HEY!” A stupid thing to say really. But you yourself don’t understand why you’re so mad at her you just know that no one EVER talked about the time before the zombies, before The Event before the dessert. <br>“OH ho ho” She spun to meet the voice and hopped down to meet it’s owner “Don’t like thinking about that do you? There was a time when Zombies were fiction and reincarnation was not quite so literal wasn’t there?” The wall was blanketed with crows now and their caws made for a buzz. “Yes and crows, crows were never on our mind” <br>“How many times have you died stranger?” The man asked the woman with profound fear. <br>“I have lost track, well over 300, I once survived 2 months but never have I seen any rain other than the occasional shaman dance” She snapped her fingers and got along with her point “How many of you have seen a natural rain?” And she was met with silence.<br>Deep in your gut you realize where you are. You’ve known if for at least 3 lives, but you never let it surface to your psyche. <br>“Why are we here” She asks and looks at you directly “You know, don’t you?”<br>You nod and everyone snaps to your location. <br>“How many times have you died?” She walks to you and you look up thinking, shaking with fear. The town is surrounded with crows now and you shrug your shoulders breathing in a shaky breath. <br>“Do you remember your first death?” She touches your shoulder with sympathy and before you say anything she says “you don’t do you? it’s okay no one does.”<br>“I… I remember my first life” You manage to blurt out “If i concentrate hard enough”<br>She nods absently and ignores that. “So where are we now, friend? Where are we now”<br>The crows shout as one so that no one hears you. Well over 100 crows surround the town, ebony feathers falling on the towns 40 heads. <br>You shout at the top of your lungs where you believe you are only to be drowned in a symphony of caws. The woman looks around and some of the smaller crows take flight, circling the town. She looks at you earnestly and nods. <br>For a moment the noise pauses, the longest 3 seconds of your life and you repeat what you had shouted. “This is Hell”<br>The crows did not want to hear that as they all take flight, no longer cawing only circling your town<br>She looks at you with sadness drawn on her face. “do you know what they call a flock of crows?” <br>Before you can answer the gates buckle and groans are heard on the other side. The town moves as one to push against the doors. You, yourself run to the doors when a bird lands on your shoulder. You look at the bird curiously, they have never touched you before and you see the telling feather on its wing. “I was right wasn’t I?” the bird caws at you as if to agree than darts at your eye ball.<br>You scream but no one can hear you as they push against the wall and try to stop the onslaught of zombies. Another peck with a sharp beak pierces your eye lid and you feel wetness run down your cheek. With your other eye you see a mound of black birds muffle a womans scream as the birds move back and forth around the town. Than you feel a needle sharp pain, than you see nothing. All you can feel is daggers over your body and wind pushing against you, your tongue is pulled out of your screaming mouth as you fall to the ground and suddenly your consciousness sears across the globe.<br>A silent scream is held in your eternal self.<br>A thousand simultaneous pains too intense for any body to contain is your experience. You know it will be over soon, you have done this a dozen times before but the pain never callosses. <br>At last, The Event. Forcibly your identity is thrust into a husk and your new body awakens. As familiar as the last. As familiar as the next. Fresh, hot air fills your lungs at once and exits with rasps. Tears stream from your new, whole eyes onto your new cheeks and a black crow perches on an old post with some red meat in its beak. <br>“You!” You say. but nothing comes out “You” once again your attempt at speech is fruitless. Your mouth feels empty. An odd feeling for a mouth. The white tipped bird drops the red meat in front of you and you realize it’s your tongue. He caws at you again and flies to the west showing you your new home.</p>

                <p>Mercy</p><br><p>Spacekadt was the only one of her group to make it out of town alive. She had fought the hordes of undead that had swarmed her town but when she saw the last of her friends fall she scaled the wall and ran. <br><a href="/tid/forum#!view/61490|thread/42373174" target="_self">Writing for fun</a><br>This was her 4th day of camping alone. She was having trouble sleeping. The ruin she was camped in was open to the night air without a roof. But four walls protected her. There was nothing to fear from the sky. Her potential death would come on foot.</p><p>When she did sleep her dreams were filled with nightmarish images of her friends falling under the mass of the walking dead. <br>She just realized today that she was dreaming in color. She had never really thought of the monochrome dreams she always had before. Only comparing her new violently colorful dreams did she realize it was different.</p><p>She heard scraping outside. Boots sliding against the small rocks she had placed as simple alerts of discovery.</p><p>She sat with her back gingerly propped against the wall. Knees raised and her hands dangling over them.</p><p>This was company she had come to expect. Although she tensed a bit. Her knife remained in her boot.</p><p>He walked through the darkness of the ruins to the room she claimed as her own. Her small campfire went unseen outside this small enclosure.</p><p>He bowed his head as he entered the door. He was tall.</p><p>He smiled at her. Her lips curved in a semblance of a smile.</p><p>He propped his walking staff by the door.</p><p>He lifted the rucksack dangling from his fingers and swung it from side to side in temptation.</p><p>He asked "Hungry?"</p><p>She scowled at him. Of course she was hungry. Her stomach felt like a deep hole of hunger.</p><p>He busied himself putting a small metal grill with 4 legs over the small fire. He placed 2 small chickens on the grill.</p><p>He talked while he prepared dinner for them both.</p><p>Did she find anything today? Was the well water still dwindling? Had she seen any walkers? Had any seen her? Has she seen the hotel nearby? Was it still full of the undead? Did she eat the dried noodles he had left her?</p><p>She tried to follow all of his questions but her head was so muddled. She had hit her head and scratched her back while scaling the wall the night of the massacre of her town. And the death of her friends.</p><p>She answered some questions and ignored others. All the questions she did answer were monosyllabic in reply. A yes or no. And even that took more mental effort than she cared to use.</p><p>She thought her depression at her friend’s deaths must be overwhelming to her. Maybe it was survivor’s guilt? Why was she the only one that got away? Why didn't she call for the others to run with her? If she had stayed could she have saved at least one? She felt a hand pick hers up. She met his eyes. His kind eyes. And hers begin to tear. <br>He said <br>"Quit thinking. Come and eat"</p><p>He had found her in the desert the first night. She was sobbing and almost incoherent with grief. She told him what had happened. He told her he would keep her safe. He brought her here to these ruins. She had assumed he was with another large group. But she never saw him with anyone and didn't ask why.</p><p>After that first night she quit speaking. Only yes(s) and no(s).</p><p>She picked up her chicken. She hated to complain to him but he was a horrid cook. The chicken was barely warm and still bloody. His looked cooked! <br>But she was hungry and the chicken WAS delicious.</p><p>After eating, she lay down with her head on her pack and just like the nights before listened to him tell stories of a civilization to come. Building from the ashes. She went to sleep to the soothing sound of his voice.</p><p>That night the dreams were so much worse. Every detail of her friend’s deaths etched in her mind to play over and over again.</p><p>She awoke several times to the feeling of a comforting hand on her hot forehead and his soothing voice. "Shhhhh...It’s almost over"</p><p>She hoped the dreams WERE almost over. She knew they were becoming debilitating. <br>Draining her of energy while she dwelled on the horrors.</p><p>She didn't hear him leave that night but she was alone when she woke in the morning.</p><p>All the next day she was weak. <br>She again thought her inability to sleep without the nightmares was catching up with her.</p><p>She didn't want to eat that night. Even the smell of the cooked food was nauseating. He didn't try to coax her. Just put the food away.</p><p>She lay with her head on her rucksack and watched him. She wondered why he always wore black. Loose black pants and a tunic. Her mind tried to make an association with something she felt she was missing. She never really questioned why he helped her. She would thank him when she was better. She would find a way to repay his kindness. But she was too tired now to think of how.</p><p>As she closed her eyes in weariness waiting for another night of being tortured with dreams she felt her shirt being pulled up. She was awake instantly. Her wild eyes met his. And she grabbed his wrists. <br>He said <br>"I need to see your back Spacey. The scratches are infected"<br>She knew he had spread salve on them before, when her fever was raging. She had felt cool comfort. <br>She let go of his wrists. She rolled to her side while he treated the scratches. When he was done he gently pulled her shirt back into place and for a moment she felt the brief touch of his hand brushing her hair back. <br>The simple gesture brought tears to her eyes. It seemed she cried at every little human comfort now.</p><p>Although he never had before, that night he stayed with her.</p><p>The next day was just little blocks of sanity. Her fever raged. Once she was twisting and moaning and her whole body seemed to have needles poking her at random. Her body convulsed. She was in such pain. His hand was again on her forehead and she wanted to tell him something. Something important about the night her friends died. But the fever took her ability to speak. During one brief moment of clarity her eyes sought his. She saw pity in his eyes.</p><p>She was so thirsty. But although he gave her sips of water it didn't quench her thirst. Or hunger.</p><p>Again she tried to tell him...needed to tell him. The night she ran? She felt the bite of one of the undead as she first scaled the wall. She made herself believe it was a protruding nail on the makeshift wall. Or a jagged piece of wood. But she knew. Oh God, she knew.</p><p>She awoke again while her fever raged. And with her eyes locked onto his begged for comfort. Surcease in the midst of an unfathomable nightmare.</p><p>He nodded. Her dry lips formed the words without sound. "Thank you"</p><p>She noticed the white collar he had added to his tunic. Finally understanding his care of her. He knew she had been infected. Had brought her food and stayed to comfort her through the transition. Her body was dying now. The next stage would be as an undead. Tears trickled into her hair as she lay on her back. She didn't want to lose her grip on her humanity. She didn't want to be a mindless creature fueled by only a need to feast on others.</p><p>He dried her tears as new ones took their place.</p><p>Again he told her. "It's almost over"</p><p>"Close your eyes now. Mercy shall follow you"</p><p>She finally fell into a dark peaceful sleep. His flock of one.</p><p>She never felt the first thrust of the staff that pierced her left eye. She didn't feel the second thrust that pierced her right one.</p><p>Mercy.</p>

                <p>I have 2 stories. Both of them are unique and I thought I would share them.<br>One of them is about <span class="tid_user tid_user_1725218 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1725218">Deblyn</span> <br>The second story is about <span class="tid_user tid_user_1438184 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1438184">Sense</span></p><p>I call this a story but this is not just a normal story. This story is more a memory I am very fond off. I know the writting might not be in the same style as deblyn her story. Though its something I would like to share. Because this story is based on a memory I will write it from my pov. Just as if it would have been written in my diary (should i have one). I will write the shorter version of what actualy happened down below the story in a spoiler marker.</p><p>This story starts after Deblyn invited me to her own town. I was doing my own thing and minding my own business while deblyn choose to start her own town. She invited some people but when I arrived it was just me and deblyn in the town. <span class="tid_wspoil">Deblyn made her own private town after getting the mayor hero unlock and invited me to it.</span></p><p>I could hear the zombies outside the town gates and would not dare to open the gates of this private town of ours without there being 39 others. I liked it here. For me it felt like eden. There were only 2 persons and we were shielded by the town gates from death that was waiting outside the gates. There was a lot of water and food. I did not get hungry or thirsty when the day ended. So for me it really felt like eden. <span class="tid_wspoil">We could not open the gates or start the town because we did not have 40 people this is needed in a private town.</span></p><p>It did not only feel like it it looked like it aswell. I did not have to worry about anything at all. I was there with just deblyn and not some random maniac. Life was good. Not good it was amazing. Awesome. lets just say there are no words to describe it.</p><p>I wish I could ask deblyn if she saw it the same way but it is to late for that now. I am locked out of this paradise and can never ever return to it. The gods have punished me for my deeds. What I did is unforgiveable. I could give excuses like she asked for it. Or I could not control myself. Though what I did was terrible and no person deserves it. As far as we knew we were immortal though I am 100% sure I can die now. <span class="tid_wspoil">You need 40 people to start a town and so it can become day 2 until then you do not have to drink. And with only 2 people you cannot die right?</span></p><p>I often think about that day and what happened. I still wonder if what I did was able to be prevented. It started out so good. I made a tent for me to sleep in. I opened my armergeddon lunchbox and my doggy bag. I still remember getting that melon. That stupid melon. Was there any way I could have known? Could I have prevented this? It looked so good. So tasty. So juicey. I decided to eat it. <span class="tid_wspoil">I had used my ap to upgrade my home to a tent and do some other upgrades. I choose to eat the melon after that.</span></p><p>I do not remember much of what happened after eating the melon. I only remeber flashes of what happened. After I ate that melon something inside of me changed. I felt an urge something evil inside of me had aweakened. It was some hunger inside of me. I could feel it it was not normal hunger I wanted to eat another person. It became stronger and stronger and the next thing I know is that I was standing over eating her. I litterly are deblyn there was nothing left but bones. The wierd part is I am pretty sure the last thing she said was OWH EAT ME AWAN!. I am still not sure what go into me. All I know is that I have eaten deblyn alive. <span class="tid_wspoil">I became a ghoul and told deblyn this in irc she asked me to eat her because it would not fill</span></p><p>The gods have thrown me out of paradise. I know I cannot return to this place. I do not even have a corpse. I killed deblyn. I still wonder why would I do this? It haunts me everyday. And I belive that is my punishment. I would do anything to undo what I did that day but I know that what I did cannot be undone. There is only one thing I can hope for and that is that deblyn is in a better place now.<br><span class="tid_wspoil">if a private town wont fill after a certain amount of days it is canceled</span></p><br><p>Deblyn, I hope you can hear me where you are. Deblyn I regret that day and hope that no one ever does anything like it again. I wish you the best and hope that you can forgive me.</p>

                <p>Sorry about the crappy story. It's my first time writing something this big creatively, on my own.</p><p><strong>Thirst.</strong></p><p>"Brains."</p><p>No. That wasn't what the horde said.</p><p>The horde said "Braaaaaaaaainnnzzz." Not much of a difference, just pronunciation. Why do I know this? No, I don't have two functioning ears. I'm part of the hive mind. I am part of the horde. My name is Derpy and I, am a zombie.</p><p>This story isn't about life as a zombie though. Well, half of it is. The first half is why I became one.</p><p><em><strong>The Melancholy Colosseum</strong></em></p><p>It was Friday morning in the little settlement in a run down Colosseum. The gates, placed on a broken piece of the wall for protection, were opened with a lever. The scavengers walked through the gate, eager to get supplies for the town.</p><p>Among one of these, was a man named Derpy. Nothing note worthy about him besides being our protagonist. He was just your daily, run-of-the-mill zombie apocalypse survivor.</p><p>He was in a group, a coalition in the wild, zombie wasteland, with Miner, Doctor Winner and a deceased fellow that I won't name, out of respect.</p><p>As they walked through the sandy wastes, Miner called out. "I wonder what it would be like to be a zombie." Derpy pondered this. "I don't know. Probably just walking, then eating, then moaning and groaning. Simple." Doctor Winner looked at the two. "If you two would stop making weird conversations, I think you should look at this."</p><p>They stayed silent as they looked at the building in front of them.</p><p>It was huge. A large, square, metal building that looked worn and torn, with roads near it and the ruins of a building. It was a nuclear bunker. They looked at eachother, then grinned. "Dibs on the supplies!" Derpy yelled. "Wait, Derpy, we haven't told the town yet-" The doctor was not heard, as Derpy ran into the building. "Goddamnit!" Winner and Miner ran in after Derpy as he explored the building for supplies.</p><p>Derpy ran into a room after entering the steel building of the Nuclear Bunker. He took a jerrycan full of water and a can of food, and an electrical component for the smart ones at the Colosseum and left the room.</p><p>He walked down the seemingly empty corridor, as a dripping sound was heard alongside his footsteps, and two others. Winners and Miners. As they caught up, the grabbed Derpys shoulder. "What the hell were you thinking?!" Miner yelled at Derpy, and they heard a groan. "I was getting supplies!" Derpy yelled back and Winner looked around as another, different groan was heard.</p><p>"Guys, save this for later. There's a horde coming. Run." doctor Winner said nervously as the pounding of slow footsteps coming closer was heard. "Shit! Run!"</p><p>The three ran to the exit, when a green, putrid, rotten hand grabbed onto Derpy's leg. He tried to shake it off, to no avail. As it brought the leg to its mouth, Derpy yelled out, "Go on without me! I'll distract them!"</p><p>Miner was in shock, but Winner shook him. "We'll remember you, Derpy." Winner said. As Miner tried to help, they saw the horde coming through, of about six zombies.</p><p>Miner still wanted to help, so the Doctor grabbed onto his collar and dragged him out, running. "No! God damnit, no! We won't leave without him!"</p><p>"Miner. He died to protect us. We have to go back to the settlement." Winner pleaded to the boy. "But he's our friend!" "AND HE'S DEAD!"</p><p>A single, black crow flew over the bunker, as silence settled.</p><p>Then, there was a scream.</p><p>Miner walked back to the Colosseum, slowly, looking at the ground. Winner kept quiet as they walked back, leaving the screams of pain and terror behind them.</p><p><em><strong>Midnight, twelve hours later.</strong></em></p><p>And that, my zombie/human/devoured kitten friends, is how I became a zombie.</p><p>What I said before my death was true. Life now involved walking, groaning and feasting on the insides of the living. It wasn't a bad life. It was simple...And a little boring.</p><p>So here I was. Attacking the settlement I called home. I think I remember the person on watch, up there on the tower. I forgot their name.</p><p>Related to a building for converting materials into other materials, I think.</p><p>I shambled to the gates and slammed my fists against it. It was futile, if I was alone. But, I wasn't. I had a horde with me.</p><p>Slam. Slam. Slam. Slam. Crack.</p><p>As I entered the town, I saw my two...Friends. As I shambled to them, I felt conflicting emotions. The hunger. I had to feed. But...They were...Friends.</p><p>Friends.</p><p>I stopped shambling and I fell to my knees. They slowly walked towards me, and I groaned out one word.</p><p>"Water."</p><p>Miner looked away as Winner came forward to confront their zombified friend. "Wa...Ter..." I repeated. Winner placed the water gun on my temple.</p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">"Water..."</span></p><p>A feint whisper. My final request.</p><p>The trigger was pulled, And Derpy's soul was finally allowed to rest.</p><p>A black crow circled the scene, and the souls of the dead followed it, to the next life.</p>

                <p>"Never leave Home without a damn reserve weapon..." Miner said in his head as he was in the ground, buried up to his chin in sand and debry. He pondered about how this happened...</p><p><strong>~in the morning~</strong><br>Miner woke up to the stench of the town shaman being showered by a water ration, people don't usually get showered but when they do they're a high up in the town. Last night's attack was monsterious, our reactor zaapped half of them to bits, a few dozen made it trough the gates and our shaman, that was out on the streets triying to get some rain to hit our well, was grabbed from behind and, well, you get the picture...</p><p>Today I went on the usuall 9 KM trip in the morning and took my trusty 3 shot water pistol with me. I found that the horde had moved a lot more than the morning announcments in the gazette predicted, i soon found my three shots to be down to one and none. I luckily found a water ration next to a corpse and went on with my 9 KM circle, a mistake that would proove to be my demise... In the evening i decided to take out one more infested zone, i loaded the water ration i found into my water pistol and shot at the zombies that were sorounding me, expecting them to melt like always, but i guess fate wanted me to legg it to somewhere where they won't eat me while i sleep. The water squirted onto the zombies that were advancing on me but it had no effect (<span class="tid_strike">Miner used water gun! It had no effect</span>), THE RATION WAS INFECTED!</p><p>It was almost evening, I was pulling some scraps into a pile that wouldn't sting me in my sleep. Soon after i crawled inside the pile and after sending out one last distress call on my Walkie-talkie (surprisingly the batteries were still in-tact) I started thinking... "Never leave Home without a damn reserve weapon..."</p><p>(sorry for the 3rd person to 1st person change but meh <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">)<br>Fin~</p>

                <p>Joanne's Story.</p><p>Joanne was scavenging alone. Typically she would have buddied up with someone but she had just joined a new town today and wanted to show she was independent and could pull her own weight.</p><p>She walked due north so she would easily find her way back to town.</p><p>Her last town was devastated and overrun by zombies. She hadn't been in that town long enough to make long lasting friendships. And the few women there were the first to be killed.</p><p>The deciding factor on her leaving the rest of the survivors behind was a simple one. Either she chose one of the remaining men as a temporary mate or there would be one forced on her. She had already seen the sidelong glances. And the open leers.</p><p>So she snuck out the first chance she got.</p><p>She shook off the memories. New place. New chance to make friends.</p><p>She looked at the cast of the sun. She thought maybe she had walked a mile. Up ahead she saw a few buildings. Ruins of another town. Underneath the light covering of wind blown sand was blacktop. Yeah!!! She was delighted! Walking on loose and shifting sand was hell on your calf muscles! She had plenty of time to take a quick look at the first building at least.</p><p>She saw a signpost ahead. It read "Valley Children Drive"</p><p>The building was a single story but sprawling.</p><p>Maybe a day care? She saw a parapet on the roof of the building and hoped it was just ornamental and not used as a guard tower.</p><p>Most children facilities are built to encourage the child not to fear the building. So they may look one story from the drive up but can actually be four or five stories as they can be built on a slope in the back. This one was built like a castle.</p><p>As she neared the building she saw a little girl of about 5 just outside the front doors. When the child saw her she screamed and ran into the propped open doors.</p><p>Joanne yelled "Hi! Wait, I'm not going to hurt you!"</p><p>But all she heard was the echoing scream as the child ran further on into the building.</p><p>Other than blonde curls and a petite tiny frame Joanne didn't get a good look at her. She hoped she was cared for. She could vouch she had remarkable lung capacity!</p><p>By this time she reached the front doors. The sign embedded in the grass beside the walkway read Valley Children's Daycare.</p><p>Joanne didn't know how much she had dreaded it being a children's hospital until she read the sign.</p><p>The electric doors were propped open with an office chair. When the electricity is lost most electric doors are devilish to open. These swung outwards.</p><p>She climbed over the chair and took a few steps into a well-lit lobby from all the huge windows. She looked up and saw glass surrounding the cupola at the center of the ceiling. No sentries there! The parapet on the roof was purely ornamental. The place was so open, clean and airy that Joanne almost expected to see a perky young woman pop up from behind the counter and ask her if she needed help.</p><p>"Hello" she called. She waited a minute and then repeated her greeting. The silence had weight. As if the building was waiting for a response with her.</p><p>Joanne decided she was going to search the building for anything useful to take back to town. She didn't have a way to get a message back to them so she hoped they would trust her to know what she was doing. She thought tomorrow when she returned to town they would be grateful she found a relatively clean building that wasn't ransacked yet. Maybe they could move here? Especially if the small children needed supervision and the comfort of adults.</p><p>This was a great place to hole up after an apocalypse. She wondered how many people were here? The exterior walls, if built to code, had to be steel enforced. The windows were all installed high and were probably tempered glass. And being on the outskirts of town was a bonus.</p><p>She heard a giggle.</p><p>She turned quickly. But didn't see anyone. What a delightful sound. She hoped the adults were just as friendly. Being a daycare, most of the kids using this place had probably been under the age of 5.</p><p>She heard another giggle. From a different area.</p><p>She decided to lure the giggling children out by ignoring them. She walked through the lobby saw a long hallway decorated with zoo animals painted on the walls. Again it was brightly lit from all the widows. What a charming place!</p><p>Joanne walked down the hall. She smelled a strong stench and briefly looked into the first door she came too. It was a bathroom with five stalls. The sinks were lower than typical bathroom. She didn't need to enter the room to know where the smell was coming from. Obviously the loss of electricity affected the flushing of the toilets. She wrinkled her nose and closed the door. <br>She thought poor little tykes.</p><p>The next room she came to was empty of people. It was a playroom with a little kitchenette and tables for doing crafts.<br>She again called out. She thought being a female; her voice may encourage the people in the building to show themselves. Again she felt the weighted silence of listening ears.</p><p>Another giggle wafted down the hallway. That was 3 children so far! The 2 she had heard in the lobby and now another down the hall.</p><p>She felt encouraged to keep searching the rooms.</p><p>The next 3 rooms she searched held nothing of much interest. She found a pack of chewing gum she pocketed. And a bottle of water! That was a welcome relief. She kept the water also.</p><p>Although the small tables and chairs had been moved around randomly in the rooms, she didn't see any other signs of habitation. Such as cots or blanket rolls. Empty food cartons. Nothing. Curious!</p><p>The artwork on the walls was charming. The small tables and chairs were delightful. This was probably the nicest place she had searched since the world, as she knew it came to an end.</p><p>She called out again. Reassurances. After seeing the environment that these people had been living in she almost felt maternal towards them all.</p><p>No answer. Just small feet pattering away from her in a distant hall or room. She heard the opening of a door and the soft pneumatic closing.</p><p>She hurried down the hall hoping she could see which door was just closing. No luck.</p><p>The light from the windows was turning dusky. She hated to rest here without making the acquaintance of the other people in the building, but she needed to find a bed for the night. In this the last room down this hall she decided to make a bed. She gathered the mats that were stacked in a corner. Probably used for nap times for the little ones.</p><p>There was a supply closet in the room and she quickly emptied it of playground equipment, balls, hula-hoops, etc.</p><p>And laid the mats down.</p><p>In the dying light of the day, She wrote on the dry erase board in the front of the room in large block writing.</p><p>"My name is Joanne. I am from the town directly south of here. I need to stay the night. I mean you no harm. I would like to talk to someone in the morning. We may be able to help each other?" She drew happy faces and hearts around her message. Even a peace sign.</p><p>She went to the spacious closet and closed the door. She wished she had a way to block the door from opening but it opened outwards. She actually felt safe in the dark warmth of the closet. Safer than she had felt the night before in her new town. She opened her canteen and sipped her stale water. It had been an exhausting day and she had no problems drifting off to sleep.</p><p>She awoke in full dark. No light shone beneath the door. She heard again the sound that probably awoke her. The soft slide of a foot. The sound of someone making their way towards the closet she lay in. <br>She reached blindly for the door handle. To prevent it from being turned. Instead she heard the lock on the closet door click. The outside lock.</p><p>Someone had just locked her in!</p><p>"Hello? Hello!!?" <br>She tried to turn the knob. It wouldn't turn at all. Her nest, that had felt so safe before she went to sleep, immediately became an airless vacuum in her mind.</p><p>She yelled "Hello! I am not going to hurt you! Please unlock the door!"</p><p>Her only reply was a muffled giggle. A hand quickly placed over a mouth.</p><p>Hyper alert, her heart pounding, she sat with her back against the wall until dawn came and the thin strip of light illuminated the closet faintly. She could hear the sounds of footsteps. And see shadows of people, a lot of people, passing close to her door. All eerily quiet.</p><p>One shadow came close to the door and Joanne just knew the person was pressing their ear to the wood.</p><p>She softly said, "Please unlock the door. I won't hurt you. I will just leave and go back to my town"</p><p>She heard a sigh and saw the shadow move.</p><p>She looked at the thin strip of light under the door and like a child, stuck her fingers under the edge. She felt the pet of another hand. She pulled her hand back in and saw other fingers wiggle under the door.</p><p>The decaying smell struck her first. In horror she looked at the small fingers. Just bone on some phalanges, rotting flesh on others. <br>She screamed.</p><p>The child giggled. A happy playful giggle. She wiggled her fingers at Joanne.<br>The lock on the door was turned with a small snick. And the knob began to turn.</p>

                <p>WalkinCrow.</p><p>The desert is beautiful. Especially twilight and dawn. Most people see a barren mass of sand, rocks, and cacti. But if they sit and listen they can find the beauty.</p><p>Around small puddles of moisture you hear crickets and frog songs. The musical yips and howls of coyotes calling out their names and intentions to other packs. The skittering of lizards and mice. The caws of ravens and crows. The shrieks of hawks and the hoots of owls. <br>The wind shifting sand. Rustling through the small stunted greenery and in and around holes in the rocks. All the sounds coalescing into a cacophony of desert music.</p><p>When the small, makeshift towns are suddenly thrown together in the desert there is only a hesitation in the desert sounds. After all the hammering and hurried noises of the small groups of people building safe places during the day, the night is quiet again and the desert music continues.</p><p>Except.<br>When he walks the darkness. <br>When the world was populated he would walk the streets at night. His boots the only sound people heard. They would look in the direction of his steps and see nothing but shadows. He has had many names. The Thin Man, The Tall Man. The Shadow. And WalkinCrow.</p><p>He walks the desert and there is silence. The wind dies, the animals freeze in fright. The coyotes lick their young so they don’t yip and draw attention to the pack.</p><p>The only animals of any kind that greet him are the ravens and the crows. For a brief time while he passes these birds rule the desert. Their caws fill the air. Their wings make their own wind.</p><p>He visits the towns. Oh, not in a “Hello, hi! Let me in to break bread with you!” <br>Not WalkinCrow. He has no need for these apocalypse survivors or their fight to survive on.</p><p>No his is a secret quest. He does not need to climb walls or beg an entry. Every door and gate is opened for him. To him.</p><p>There is no one that refuses him. Because he is small subconscious voice in their heads. A suggestion. That does not even become a memory. When he wants to enter a ramshackle town he just throws out the suggestion and someone opens the gates for him. <br>No acknowledgment as he enters.</p><p>He walks alone through the towns. As he passes his presence is a chill down the spine. Maybe a quick look over a shoulder. But the only thing they may see is an elongated shadow on a tent wall. Or the sound of fading boot steps. Some may get the feeling that they need to cover the leg they left uncovered in the dark. Or maybe cuddle closer to the person they are sharing a bedroll with.</p><p>He is made of darkness. His is the harbinger of doom.</p><p>Sometimes he will loosen boards; unhinge a gate, little things that the people that walk the wall may not see the next day. But, oh. What a difference it will make when the horde arrives at midnight. The ease of access. The complacency that is broken!</p><p>The grief or consternation of the townsfolk. The finger pointing and the blame.</p><p>Why? You ask? “Why not?” He would reply. His is a lonely trek. And he finds his amusement in chaos.</p><p>This is a cautionary tale. Check your walls, check your water. Daily. Don’t grow complacent with your makeshift town. Be prepared. This is his legacy to you.</p><p>If only someone could tell of his sabotage.</p><p>But no one knows him. Knows of him. Just the ravens and crows.</p><p>And of course, the desert.</p>

Unimportant things like water, can openers, bandages... stuff.</p><p>"What time is it?" Joanne groggily asked, rubbing the search-sand from her eyes to reveal a small pile of junk. "Worthless! We've already got 50 of these!" Joanne kicked aside a Chuck Norris figurine.</p><p>"Well Joanne... It's time to run!" Deblyn screamed as zombies began literally climbing from the earth beneath us.</p><p>"I saw a medical hospital just 2 North of here! If we run we can make it!"</p><p>"Joanne! Deblyn!" Miner screamed, uppercutting two of the zombies. "I was sent to join you with these!" Miner pulled a concrete block, exploding hand, and actual, real live bullets from a manbag.</p><p>"We've got to run!" Deblyn said, grabbing us both and escorting us toward the medical hospital.</p><p>"Get the door! Miner?! Why are you- give me that crowbar! Pull!" <br>Miner pulled the door open, Derpenstein came out of nowhere and we all tumbled in, just to hear the world's creepiest voice:</p><p><em><strong>Welcome to my LABORATORY! Please... get comfortable. YOU'LL BE HERE A WHILE!</strong></em></p><p>The door slammed behind us, and we were trapped in.</p>

                <p>A love Story: Katja and Bram</p><br><p>Katja and Bram lay on their backs on the sand dune. They were both looking up at the night sky. Deliberately avoiding looking at each other. <br>Katja sniffled and Bram squeezed her hand gently. <br>He said “Honey, don’t cry, you will make me cry”<br>Katja replied in a small wail “I can’t help it. Everything will change!”<br>Bram responded “No. It won’t. I love you”<br>She sniffed and turned over on her side to look at him. He also turned. <br>He reached over to brush her hair back and her right ear fell into his hand. She didn’t notice so he dropped it above her head and pushed at the sand to cover it. He hoped his face did not show any emotion. <br>She sighed and turned to lie on her back again. She absently picked up his hand and scratched her leg with the stiffened fingers. When she realized what she was doing she handed him the hand. He tucked it back into the shirt pocket it had fallen from.</p><p>Bram said, “Tonight may be our last chance. We are literally falling apart! We have talked about it. We agreed!”<br>He took the hand back out of his shirt pocket so he could shake a finger in her face.<br>She snatched the hand from him and threw it over his shoulder. “I hate when you do that. Its rude!”</p><p>He rolled over to his side reaching for the hand. He brushed the sand off and put it back into his pocket with the fingers sticking out.</p><p>“I don’t know why you keep that old thing anyway,” She said.</p><p>He didn’t respond. It was the only thing he had left of his dads. She knew how important it was to him. <br>She slid closer to him and laid her head on his shoulder. “I am sorry, dear.”<br>He hugged her closer. Ignoring the feeling of loose skin sliding over ribs.</p><p>“Lets do this proper. Ok?” He said</p><p>“Proper? How can we do it proper?”<br>She picked up the leg that still itched and put it under her head to use as a pillow.</p><p>She moved her head over a bit so he could share. He rested his head on her foot and looked at her profile in the moonlight. She was his one true love. They had been together for years. And thought they had many more years. But this damn apocalypse had been the death of them. They had been so happy. Always traveling. Never settling down in any one place for long. Working only to make money to travel more. What a life they had. He smiled at her. Ignoring the dark gap where her ear had fallen off.</p><p>She turned her head a little and gave him a side-long glance. She smiled back at him. He could feel several of the remaining teeth in his mouth drop on his tongue. He didn’t want to upset her so he pulled the hand back out of his shirt pocket and while saying “On my dads honor I want do this now, tonight” He pretended to kiss the hand while dropping 3 teeth into the palm. When she smiled mistily at him he slung the teeth over his shoulder and put the hand back in his pocket.</p><p>She said, “I do love you, goofy man. You know that. We don’t HAVE to do this. Our life together was just fine as it was”</p><p>He cupped her cheek in his hand and said, “We have done everything. We thought we would have time. All the time we needed. This one thing is our last hurrah, our last rodeo, our last commitment, our last….”</p><p>“Oh for Gawds sake!” <br>“Just shut the hell up and lets get on with it. All of us are getting riper!!!!”<br>“What? Do they think we don’t have any other business tonight?”<br>“This is so romantic”<br>Sniffles “My baby is so grown up”</p><p>Bram rolls his eyes. One getting stuck in the upward roll, giving him a quizzical expression. “Oh mom”</p><p>Katja struggled to sit up. She looks at all their loved ones that came out tonight. They were all here to share this special occasion. All the ones that were left. They were a ragged bunch of 15. Most missing limbs, eyes, ears, maybe 20 teeth amongst them all. But love. Plenty of that. They were scattered over the dune.</p><p>Bram and Katja thought they had a lifetime yet to be lived. They put off getting married because…. well, because they knew where their life was going and they would be going there together. A piece of paper would not have made them love each other more or bind them together any tighter. But now….</p><p>Her great uncle would be the one performing the ceremony. He was just a head. Many of the family made jokes about that! But tonight he looked regal in his Shriner’s hat with the little tassel. And she thought, lets be honest. Its not like he could wear anything but headgear.</p><p>She said, “Ok, I am ready.”</p><p>She blindly grabbed Bram’s hand and realized it was his dads. He gently removed the stiffened claw and entwined his fingers with hers. Being careful so neither one of them lost fingers.</p><p>They turned to face a head. I mean ahead.</p><p>Bram’s mom sniffled so much she blew off her nose. That was the only casualty of the ceremony.</p>

                <p>I've had 4 short stories published. My favorite was a fishing story in Wisconsin. Of course that was a humor story but it was published in a fishing magazine and in 2 hmmmmmm what do you call them. The publications that the city tourists offices put out? I am better at writing quick stories than longer ones with more details. The shorter the story the less details I need. More scenario type stories. I would love to take a writing class. That would be great fun!</p>

                <p>It has been 1000 days since the walker outbreak. Struggling to survive had been a difficult journey throughout it all.</p><p>Our group of 42 had arrived at our current location on day 951, an abandoned town somewhere in the desert. Our leader fward suggested that it would be a good idea to venture into the desert, to avoid walkers from higher populated areas. He also emphasized the importance of bringing as much water as possible. After we arrived, we were hoping to spend our time scavenging in the desert for more resources, and using those resources to build beneficial constructions. Unfortunately to our surprise, there was no resources whatsoever in the desert around the town. Although what could we have expected, it's not like enough people lived around these parts to drop many items. At the very least, we didn't have to deal any walkers. We hadn't seen a single walker since day 948, 3 days before we arrived at the abandoned town.</p><p>On day 979, we ran out of water. This caused 2 of us to die from dehydration. Amazingly on day 982, Sinistra and JasonBourne discovered a Well somewhere in the town, with about 480 water rations in it. Our leader fward was so pleased, that he promoted them both to co-second-in-command. Even though they saved all of our lives, I felt the two of them getting more power than the rest of us due to luck they had, was unfair. But nothing I can do about it, it's fward's word, and that's that. If it wasn't for him, I would have died 2 1/2 years ago, so I trust his judgement.</p><p>On day 999, we were practically out of food, each of us only having one or two more doggy bags and lunchboxes left. Food these days have been quite disappointing anyway, almost all of it was expired. Although we still needed it to survive, along with water. We were about to die soon with what little food we had, and with only about 110 water rations left in the Well. We needed a miracle.</p><p>Today, on day 1000, there was a really bad sandstorm. So bad that we needed to completely cover our eyes the entire time. After the storm, our scouts discovered that all sorts of resources and materials from distant towns, flew all the way out here into the desert around our town. The sand from the storm covered these items, but digging them up won't be a problem. What was a problem was that our scouts detected walkers coming our way. We didn't know if it was the sandstorm, or if they were simply traveling towards us, but we knew we were in trouble. Starting tomorrow, day 1001, we must do our best to scavenge and work on beneficial constructions as much as we can. We are survivors.</p>

He proceeded to try and open the door but he just proceeded to slam his head onto the door from it not moving as expected.</p><p>"Damn fool also used a lock on the door." One of the guards commented. "You three!" The mayor pointed at Miner, Derp and Winner "Find a way in!"</p><p>The three proceeded to run around the house before coming back to the front entrance, Miner cupping his hands before proceeding to boost the other two up onto the roof before raising his hands and getting pulled up onto where the other two were.</p><p>The front door proceeded to unlock from the inside and as it was opened dust rolled out and a Derp with an axe was seen fighting a lone zombie with just one arm. "Mission accomplished sir!" Miner jokingly said before being pushed aside by the Mayor.</p><p>"Look trough every corner of this place to find any entry points or leftover loot or zombies" He said as he entered, Derp just about managed to hit the zombie's head when he finished explaining.</p><p>As they searched trough it no additionall items were found and luckily no zombies either. "Lock the door, some people stand guard on the hole of the roof that you guys came trough" he proceeded to look up and see the sun shining inside "How long mmight this take, may i ask?" the mayor asked. "It takes time and patience to persuade the spirits to give out secrets such as these..." the old man answered, "So I assume you might need the rest of the day?"<br>"If you want to get your hopes up for luck then yes" the old man replied again.</p><p>They proceeded to let the old man lock the door and the mayor, a guard and the trio climbed onto the roof. The plan was in motion.</p><p><strong><em>Time skipsssssss</em></strong></p><p>The man was chanting in the house already for three hours and dusk was beginning to creep onto the horizon.</p><p>A silent clicking could be heard in the house, but noone noticed, then an equally (not)heard creak. You could see a sihlouette in the shadow of the home's corridor.</p><p>The old Man was chanting at a bright blue flame in the middle of a room.</p><p>The figure crept up slowly yet swiftfully twoards the old man, a dagger in hand, he was already at the end of the the hallway that lead to the room and was now already in the room.</p><p>He licked his lips under his hood, some drool escaping from the edges of his lips as he neared his target.</p><p><strong>He raised his dagger and...</strong></p><p><em>well damn this is going to be a nother cliffhanger i guess, i might post the next part straight up maybe? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/question.png" alt=":?:" class="tid_ico"> dunno, let's see how evil i feel today <img src="../../../../gfx/square/keepcool.png" alt=":K" class="tid_ico"></em></p>

"Yeah me too" the other guard on the roof said</p><p>The old man, guard and the knocked out person walked out twoards the door "Let's hope he didn't jam the lock when he locked it again" the guard said as he reached for the doorknob and twisted the lock under it, luckily the lock twisted and clicked open.</p><p>They opened the door and walked out.<br>"So, where is he?"

Derp asked, first, followed by the other three.</p><p>"They <strong>cough</strong> came out, doormat, click, boom..." Miner could barely talk, the wind knocked out of him and probably some broken ribs.</p><p>Silence engulfed them as other citizens rushed twoards the house cariying stagnant water to try and seduce the fire that was almost spreading twoards the nearby homes...</p><br><br><p>"As you all know, there has been a ghoul incident a few days ago, and as you all know there was a big fire in one of the safest houses in town earlier today... it was caused by a doormat bomb." The mayor talked as the town was grouped in the middle of the town.</p><p>"We aren't sure yet but we have three theories, the best one for us is that the guy who originally built the house left us a little 'house warming present', the next one is that the ghoul that snuck into the house and tried attacking us as a last restort left it for us in case he failed, or the worst case scenario... another ghoul left it there, knowing the first one would fail... whichever one of these is the true one... we will work at our best to defend you and ourselves..."</p><p><strong>Okay, so i would say this is the peak of the arc... let's see what else this holds later, shall we? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></strong></p>

                <p>Hetch was sometimes a pain in the ass, but he was one of the living, and one who wasn’t hell bent on feeding me to his dead wife, or raping a pretty biter, or blinded by an overzealous preacher-man. He was normal, for what that was worth. Normal was relative in the old world. It was unheard of in the dead one.</p><p>We’re all just a little messed up in some way or other. We’ve all seen things…done things…</p><p>And maybe that’s what made him Hetch: he was as normal as they came in this screwed up world.</p><p>It took almost a full week before he was strong enough to do anything besides lie around or nap. There were times where he acted like a little kid, whining about not feeling well and wanting me to bring him his meals. I watched his temperature like a mom to that whiny kid, checking it often. I also made a run into Batesburg for medicine, passing the armory of dead soldiers along the way. There were biters, but not as many as I expected to see in the town proper.</p><p>The drug store was empty of life of any kind. And there were plenty of bottles of medicine—Tylenol, Ibuprofen, Aleeve, Excedrine, and a whole host of generic brands as well. I took as long as I could, gathering medicines in plastic bags I found at the front counter and throwing them in a buggy. There was water and Gatorade and chips and crackers and some canned goods, and bandages and…and I realized then that the little town had no survivors. It was a startling epiphany that made me cold all the way to the bone.</p><p>I’ve never had that feeling like someone was watching me even though there was no one else around. Until then. I looked around the immediate area, saw no one in the gray shadows of the store. I pulled out my pistol and pushed the buggy toward the front. The hairs on my neck stood on end and I couldn’t shake the shiver that had crawled up my spine. It was like someone had taken a piece of ice and touched me on the back of the neck.</p><p>Outside there were half dozen biters roaming the streets. I shoved the gun back in my waistband and slid the machete from its sheath. I had to be quick. To let them notice me before I could take a few of them out meant running for the truck before I was ready. Though I was almost positive I would never return to that drug store, or even that little town, I still needed the supplies I had stacked in the buggy.</p><p>I moved quietly, sneaking up behind the first few and bringing the machete over the tops of their heads with ease. Two or three others noticed and turned toward me. I took them out before they grew too close to each other, and then made my way back to the van and got in. In the driver’s seat, I exhaled and put my head on the steering wheel, my hands gripping to either side of it.</p><p>The air of the town began to give me the creeps, as if the ghosts of all the dead surrounded me. My skin crawled as if hundreds of tiny hands slid along my body. The feeling swallowed me, consumed me to the point of wanting to get out of there. I started to leave, then stopped. I had left the buggy of supplies on the sidewalk.</p><p>“Shit!”</p><p>I looked around again. There were no more biters to be seen. Honestly, I don’t think it would have been so terrible if there had been a thousand of them right then. At least the dead were physical—I could see them. I could hear them. I could react to them. The way I felt right then getting out of the van was more dangerous because I couldn’t see what could harm me.</p><p>I opened the van door and got out. The buggy’s wheels were loud on the concrete, shaking the metal frame as they hit each crack and bump along the way. The side door opened, and I tossed supplies inside haphazardly, not caring if anything spilled out. I shoved the cart aside. It bumbled a few feet before tipping over, crashing with a loud clatter of metal on concrete.</p><p>I hissed, suddenly angry with myself for the extra noise. Then I saw it. Out the corner of my eye. I turned, my hand already pulling the machete from its sheath. It was a zombie. It had to be.</p><p>But it wasn’t.</p><p>I stared at the dog. It was brown and white and thin. It was small and scruffy and dirty and pathetic looking. It was probably as hungry as I was.</p>

                <p>“Hey,” I said. “Hey, little dog.”</p><p>I hadn’t seen many animals since the end of the world began, and this one looked as lonely as I had been—still was. I took a step forward. It took a step back. Both hands went out in front of me.</p><p>“It’s okay. It’s okay. I’m not going to hurt you.”</p><p>Another step forward and the dog backed away again.</p><p>We stared at each other a while longer.</p><p>“Stay here,” I said, as if the dog was going to listen. It had probably been through as much as any person had. I went back into the drug store. It took a minute, but I found the pet food section. It was close to the back of the store. I grabbed a bag of dog food and made my way to the front. The dog was gone by the time I got back outside with the bag open.</p><p>“Doggie?” I called softly, not raising my voice too loud.</p><p>I made my way around the corner of the drug store.</p><p>“Doggie?”</p><p>The backside of the store held nothing more than garbage and a run down car that probably wouldn’t crank up in an emergency. I made my way to the front, turned and walked down the street a little way. I didn’t get too far before I heard the dog growling.</p><p>On the other side of a parts store stood the dog. His fur was on end and his tail was rimrod straight. But he wasn’t running. He growled, then barked, and then backed away. Standing in that little alleyway between the parts store and another store were several biters. At first they didn’t notice me. I wasn’t sure if somewhere in their brains they recalled how dangerous an angry dog could be. Or maybe they were just as dumbfounded as I was to see a living animal. It didn’t matter one way or the other. The dog was food for the dead. As I think about it, many people would have considered him food for the living. Yeah, maybe that’s why it didn’t let me near him.</p><p>In this world…in this shit hole those of us that remained still lived in, seeing a dog was like seeing the past. It was Fido and Rex and Lassie saving little Timmy. It was man’s best friend trying to survive without man, and man trying to survive without dogs. It was ‘Scooby Doo where are you?’ It was Sam from I Am Legend taking on vampire dogs and saving Will Smith’s behind. It was everything that was right about the old world, and everything that was wrong about this new one.</p><p>The stalemate ended when the biters started shambling forward, some of them going after the dog, some of them coming for me. I dropped the dog food and had the machete out in as quick of a motion as I could. I swung it in a wide arc, taking off the tops of two biters’ heads. I swung again.</p><p>And again.</p><p>And again.</p><p>With each biter I took down another one replaced it. What was going on? That alleyway wasn’t that big. Where were they all coming from?</p><p>I drew my pistol and took the nearest one to me out. The biter’s head snapped back with the force of the blow. The bullet exited the back of his skull and struck a woman behind him in the forehead. They both fell, like dominoes, one bumping into another, and then they struck a couple more. In seconds, half dozen biters were on the ground.</p><p>I pulled the trigger a few more times. The dead fell, their bodies like matchsticks or kindling, forming a barrier that the others couldn’t quite get through without falling over. For them, it was a final death sentence and I was their executioner.</p><p>One.</p><p>Two.</p><p>Three.</p><p>Four.</p><p>Five.</p><p>Six.</p><p>How many more? So many in such a tiny space.</p><p>Seven.</p><p>Eight.</p><p>Nine.</p><p>Damn it, where were they coming from?</p><p>I heard growling from behind and spun to see the dog crouching, as if it were about to strike. There, at the mouth of the alley were several more biters, coming to the party, I guess.</p>

                <p>“Shit!”</p><p>With a wall of dead bodies to one end of the alley, I started for the entrance. Before I got there the dog lunged at one of the biters, hitting it in the stomach. It ripped at the woman as she fell to the ground. It jerked its head from side to side, tearing rotten flesh from her, but not killing her, not like I guess the dog thought it would.</p><p>I couldn’t risk a shot, so I turned the gun to those still standing. Three shots and the gun was empty, but the biters at the entrance were down and not getting up. The dog was gone again, but the female biter was still struggling to get up. She struggled no longer when I was finished.</p><p>Behind me the wall of flesh had held the remaining biters at bay. I stood for a moment, looking, watching. Then I realized the alley I was in lead to the entrance of a building. The door was open and the dead piled out of it.</p><p>I watched. It’s all I could do. Everyone who had survived in that little town must have went to that building as a safe house, somewhere they could conjugate or…no, that wasn’t it. I was wrong in so many ways, but the biggest of those was how many people would have survived the initial outbreak. This town might have supposedly had a safe haven in the armory just outside of its boundaries, but within…within there was no way this many people survived.</p><p>Unless.</p><p>“They are the people who came here to escape.”</p><p>Suddenly I had hope. Just as suddenly, it was gone.</p><p>If Bobby and Jake were in there, they were dead. They weren’t in the armory. They weren’t at the Table Rock cabin. If they were there, they were dead.</p><p>I was sapped of energy. In the span of fifteen seconds I went from hoping I would find family members to knowing there was no way they could be alive, not in that building where biters still filed out of.</p><p>My shoulders slumped; I left the wall behind me, stepped over the biters at the mouth of the alley and stopped back on the street. The dog was a few buildings down. He had pulled the open bag of food away from the alley and now had his head buried in it. I couldn’t blame him.</p><p>Back at the van I grabbed a gas can. I hated wasting the fuel, but I had to take care of the dead. Bobby or Jake could have been among them. I hated the idea that if they were in that building then they would suffer unbelievable pain before they died, I couldn’t go in after them. It was the only way.</p><p>It was the only way.</p><p>The ghosts were all there, and they begged to be silenced.</p><p>I doused the wall of corpses with fuel. I went back to the mouth of the alley and cut away the shirt of one of the biters there. I found some stones and bricks and wrapped them in torn strips of cloth before soaking them with gas. I tossed them into the crowd, and then went back to the front of the buildings. The parts store was on my left. I smashed the window with one of the stones and went inside. There were no dead there, only the wisps of their lives.</p><p>More gasoline went onto the floors and counters and shelves. I made sure and doused the oil shelves as well as I could. With the can empty, I left it on the floor, went back to the van and got a lighter.</p><p>The dog was gone, the bag of food, ripped open, most of it still lying on the sidewalk. I guess he had his fill.</p><p>I took another piece of clothing from the dead, and dipped it in the gas in the middle of the floor of the parts store. I went back outside, lit the arm of the shirt and watched as a flame quickly engulfed it.</p><p>“Bobby, Jake, if you’re in there, I’m sorry.”</p><p>Then I tossed the shirt into the store. There was a loud ~WHOOSH~ even before the shirt hit the floor. Flames raced through the building. I backed away and watched. Soon the entire store was burning. When the flames leaped from it to the stores on either side of it, I walked away.</p><p>I got in the van and closed the door quickly. For good measure, I locked the door. Even inside the van I felt out of sorts, as if at any minute the boogey man from under some kid’s bed was going to grab me and pull me from the vehicle.</p><p>I shook my head, trying to rid myself of the feeling. It didn’t work. I sat there for the longest time, watching as flames hopped from building to building. A few biters appeared from shops or around corners, their bodies on fire. Most of them didn’t get very far before collapsing. Those that did manage to get away from the buildings still didn’t make it beyond the road before they, too, dropped to the ground where they died, in agony, I suppose.</p><p>My heart hurt as I watched them die. Deep down inside, I hoped none of them were Bobby and Jake, though, honestly, I felt somewhere in that mass of rotting corpses they were there.</p><p>I also hoped I would see the dog again. Man’s best friend and all that. I didn’t.</p><p>As day began to give way to dusk, I cranked up the van and left the small town behind.<img src="../../../../gfx/square/zombie.png" alt=":zombie:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/square/zombie.png" alt=":zombie:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/square/zombie.png" alt=":zombie:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Breeding will tell</p><p>Delores' eyes opened when the alarm rang. The clock was the old fashioned kind that you wind up every day. This one was so old that the second hand had rusted and fallen to the bottom of the cloudy plastic covering the face of the clock. It trilled so loud and with so much effort it almost walked itself across the bedside table. She slapped at it. Blessed quiet.</p><p>She moaned as she stretched. Getting out of bed lately seemed to be getting harder and harder. <br>Eh, whatever. <br>At her age what could she expect?</p><p>She shuffled into the bathroom to begin her daily rituals. <br>That too was becoming a bit of a chore.</p><p>The bathroom was well lit from the large windows.</p><p>She studied her reflection in the mirror. Turning her head from side to side. <br>Not bad. Not bad.</p><p>She used a hair tie to pull her hair gently away from her face. <br>Then opened the large kit that was on the counter.</p><p>She removed the tube of spackle. Next she took out the little trowel. After squeezing a generous amount onto the trowel she began to fill in the cracks. Starting on her forehead.</p><p>She had always prided herself on her porcelain skin.</p><p>With a practiced hand she quickly spread the white spackle over her face and neck. A few times she would use the putty knife to dig out older lumpy areas and refill with new spackle.</p><p>She also used the spackle on her eyelids. When it was dry she wouldn't be able to blink. But she thought it gave her a limpid eye look. Once she blinked while the spackle was semi dry and was unable to pry her eyes open for hours. Lesson learned.</p><p>Also, the time she smiled before it was completely dry. That was a fiasco. Once she put lipstick on, her face was a frozen parody of the joker. It was NOT the look she was going for.</p><p>She sat on the closed lid of the toilet and waited for the stuff to dry.</p><p>She couldn't take showers anymore because the water pressure caused the skin to slough off. Making little craters that filled with water and leaked for hours.</p><p>So, when the spackle was completely dry she used a soft wash cloth and cool water to pat herself down. Under her gown. Patting versus rubbing was the key.</p><p>She then used a filler, fix-a-flat, to fill in any new cracks on her abdomen and thighs. The foam lasted for weeks before having to be removed and refilled with new foam.</p><p>She drew on eyebrows with a sharpie marker. Making sure the arch of the brows matched by measuring with a ruler. <br>Then started contouring her face.</p><p>She used a dark shade of pancake makeup to promote her now sharply defined cheekbones. While blending it in a circular motion she was careful to avoid her hairline.</p><p>Although the spackle was now dry trying to rid any makeup from her hair with the damp cloth may rewet the spackle and cause it to crack.</p><p>Today, everything was going well. She started humming as she finished her morning routine.</p><p>She hummed a lot. Singing was out of the question because she couldn't move her lips. Which, by the way, were now covered in a bright fuchsia pink. But she had become adept at talking with her lips slightly parted and just moving her tongue.</p><p>Poor Helen, next door, had lost her tongue a few months ago and although she looked well preserved and made up everyday her contributions to conversations had become grunts and uh-huhs. The other women humored her by asking her yes or no questions but it was obvious that Helen was unhappy. Oh, you couldn't tell by her face! She had a spackled mask like the rest of the ladies.</p><p>Although Barbara's eyebrows became stranger everyday. She wore one up and the other one down. One thick and straight the other one curved and thin. On any given day her eyebrows expressed concern, anger, shock, questioning...it was very unsettling so most of the ladies stopped looking at her eyebrows to determine her mood.</p><p>Delores looked at her own eyebrows and was pleased. She would just die before leaving the house in less than her stellar best.</p><p>As she walked from the bathroom back to the bedroom she noticed her left foot was dragging a little bit more today.</p><p>She would have to visit Wilson again and have him wire it on tighter.</p><p>She sighed. And of course she would have to offer some kind of sexual favor.</p><p>All the women knew his penis had fallen off months ago. He was stuffing his pants with rolled up socks. And the sock penis was getting bigger every day. As if.</p><p>All the ladies had talked about him, well Helen grunted, that the lump in his trousers in no way looked like the petrified brown stub that was his penis a few months ago.</p><p>Maybe Delores could get away with stroking the sock through his trousers while moaning how big it was. While he preened.</p><p>She practiced moaning a few times. Yes, she could do that.</p><p>Meanwhile her foot was only dragging a little. She wouldn't have to moan for Wilson's sock monkey for at least another week.</p><p>She debated what to wear today. <br>She wished she had more choices. <br>But pants and long sleeves were the only practical things she could wear.</p><p>She wore short sleeves the other day and all her catty friends made a point of telling her she looked great. But she knew she looked positively skeletal.</p><p>There comes a point in a woman's life where you can't look back. No more short skirts for her. No more halter tops. <br>Dignity was a hardship sometimes.</p><p>She decided on the fuchsia colored track suit out of the 11 other colors she had to choose from.</p><p>She pulled her gown over her head and checked the tape wrapped in multiple layers around her ribs-torso. She added a few strips here and there for a more svelte look.</p><p>Mary Jane padded hers so heavily it was obscene! And then she needed help getting in and out of chairs. <br>But then, Mary Jane did come to them from the "other side of the tracks" probably even further down the tracks than they realized. NOT that there was anything wrong with that. But breeding will tell eventually.</p><p>She sat on the bed and pulled on 3 layers of long sleeved thermal underwear. Then 4 pairs of knee high socks. Her feet and legs were so important.</p><p>Poor Melinda lost a leg about a month ago. It just snapped in two. <br>She told the ladies she went to see Wilson and he made her a new leg out of maple wood. But her gait was all wonky. <br>Like John Wayne's hip-shot walk.</p><p>Everyone assured her it looked completely natural. But to be honest, with that walk, Melinda could wear a little more bling and make some obscure hand signs and look right at home in a gang.</p><p>Delores chuckled. Then felt guilty for making fun of her friends.</p><p>Just last week Maria was laughing so hard she had yelled through her spackled hardened lips "stop. I can't take anymore" which made them laugh even harder until they realized Maria's brain fluid was leaking from her ears. She really couldn't take it anymore.</p><p>Delores tut-tutted.</p><p>Poor Maria. She really was almost catatonic. They tried to include her in the daily bridge games but it had come to the point of it being ludicrous. She was over calling the bids. Whenever anyone asked her what her bid was she said five. Every time. "Ife" no one wanted to partner her anymore.</p><p>As it was, Delores knew that Maria had not spackled since the brain leak. She saw Wilson leading her to his shop the other night. And she didn't come out again until daybreak. <br>The perverted bastard. He had made her breasts. Probably more of his sock witchery.</p><p>But still. People can't take advantage of the infirm.</p><p>Delores finished dressing. Time to meet the other ladies. She pulled her hair into a topknot and secured it with a few well placed bobby pins. She didn't dare brush it anymore. It comes out by the handful it seems. So carefully placed pins gave her a slightly mussed look. But it worked for her.</p><p>Most of the ladies were wearing wigs now. But Delores wasn't there yet.</p><p>Delores firmly believed that women dress for other women to admire. Men, with their mushy brains, could care less.</p><p>But even here and now in this post apocalyptic world.... Looks mattered. Women knew this.</p><p>Yes, some had to eat their husbands to survive. No one talked about this of course. Except Mary Jane! She described in detail how Howard her husband had been felled. Like a strong tree. She hacked his legs off and ate those first.</p><p>Breeding will tell.</p><p>Keeping up appearances was important. Airing dirty laundry was so....ummmm dirty. <br>Delores headed towards the door. Her girlfriends were waiting.</p>

                <p><span class="tid_sideNote">The beginning of a written essay I did a while ago. This piece has no name and consists of <em>Prologue 1 - Cold Dark</em>, <em>Prologue 2 - The ones who met</em>, <em>Chapter 1 - The end</em>, <em>Chapter 2 - Feelings</em>.</span></p><p><em>Untitled</em></p><p><em><strong>Prologue 1 – Cold dark</strong></em></p><p>It was ice cold and dark.<br> <br>The two things I remember when I first woke up on this foreign land. My laying body numb to that torturing cold. My eyes covered shut by that infinite black. No source of light or heat. There was only that freezing darkness.</p><p>Not that it had bothered me.</p><p>A living person would have probably died in that situation. Consumed by the fear of not knowing what’s in front of him, slowly succumbing to the pain. Then realizing that it was all for naught after using all your energy just to remain sane. I wouldn’t recommend that to anyone.</p><p>So why was I still alive, you wonder? It was simple, clear like the space I existed in. I wasn’t.</p><p>Yes, indeed. I could say that Death had found me. Well… It’s not as if I could hide from Death. That black cloaked guy with his tall and terror-giving sickle always got his target. He slowly drew nearer and nearer and when he unexpectedly caught up, it was already too late. The thing is though, if I was dead, how the hell was I still alive? I mean, I could feel and think. Had I become a living corpse? Wandering between the realms of the living and the dead? Did Death do a mistake, perhaps?</p><p>Surely he did.</p><p>As I was laying there for what seemed an eternity, I did find a hobby, surprisingly. Not that I had much of a choice. If you were a zombie, a stuck zombie if I may add, you would probably have had the same activity as mine and that is - thinking. Thoughts ranging from deep philosophical questions to the likes of “How was my day today?” had been swirling in my head like a daily ritual. It was the only thing I could do, really. Having no memories of how I got there, who I was, hadn’t helped my situation. If anyone had to ask “What does a mind in a dead body do to pass time,” the correct answer would be thinking.</p><p>An alternative choice would be mindlessly waiting. But that had gotten pointless after a while. Ultimately, there had been nothing to look forward to.</p><p>End of Prologue 1 - Dark Cold</p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">So? How did you like it?

                <p><em><strong>Prologue 2 – The ones who met</strong></em></p><p>Death, a fate many would like to avoid. But not me. I hadn’t feared death nor had I craved for life. “What is death anyway,” I asked myself while I was still laying motionlessly in that prison I called “my body”. To find the answer to my question I had to first look at the other half and that was - life.</p><p>To live meant to see, to hear, to taste, to smell, to feel. All five senses made a living being’s life. They fed the brain; acted as fuel for the engine and when the gears stopped, death had taken place. Every motion, every action, each thought process became undone.</p><p>Reset. Point zero.</p><p>“Was this truly the case,” I pondered. Everything had its origins, so where were my thoughts coming from? The answer stood before me. From the black I saw, to the cold I felt.</p><p>The container I was stuck in wasn’t the catalyst which was feeling the temperature, which saw the never-ending darkness. It didn’t have the ability to. My thoughts, on the other hand, did.</p><p>I was a soul that could feel, thoughts that didn’t disappear when they should have. An unordinary spirit stuck in a body. Inside the body existed only black and chill.</p><p>Time flew and with that, events happened. Death ended life, turned it into nothing. Life was born from nothingness and so were my thoughts. In the dark, the cold place where I woke up to, the clocks weren’t so generous. They stopped ticking for me. While in the living realm seconds passed by, in the dimension I was in, my soul experienced an infinite amount of time. That was the difference between life and death. They were the two opposites that should’ve never met.</p><p>So there I was, doing nothing but speculating, having no idea who or where I was, why I existed, while the deep black enveloped me in its comfortable arms.</p><p>Now that I have looked back, it truly was a fitting beginning to my long awaited journey.</p><br><br><p><em><strong>Chapter 1 – The end</strong></em></p><p>One infinite second later, as I was doing what I was always doing, something happened. Something different. I felt motion. An unseen force pushed me in all directions. It was the first time; I experienced another feeling than cold. At the same time, something else welled up inside of me. It wasn’t clear, yet it seemed to be there from the very beginning. Like an egg waiting to hatch, it was just hiding, waiting for the right moment. As it revealed itself I slowly realised what has been happening.</p><p>It was time.</p><p>I was being freed from that icy and dark place, from that empty cell, from that hollow body. For the first time, I felt as if I’ve had experienced something new. These old buried emotions came back to me, rising from a place in the most inner corner of my soul. They immediately clashed into battle as soon as they met. Fighting, tearing each other apart, painting furiously on the canvas which was me. “Stop,” I told them. But they weren’t listening. The feelings took over the thoughts. I lost control.</p><p>“We’re free,” said one of them, “Hurray!”</p><p>As he continued his chant, one of the others was trying to reach him. “Calm down. We are not out yet. At this current point, we’re still stuck in here.” Unfazed, the chanting one continued, “Hurray! We’re free!”</p><p>Meanwhile, another voice appeared, “I don’t want to leave. What if we vanish again? We may die out there! Can we not do that please?” None replied the reluctant one. Each time someone spoke up, one of the others would talk louder and louder.</p><p>“Yes! Yes! Yes! Finally! I can’t wait for this! Let’s go! Let’s go! Let’s go!” It came out to be another fella. He seemed to very impatient. As he went on, a cry suddenly broke out.</p><p>“Uwaaaah!” it sobbed. “Waaaaah!”</p><p>“Can someone shut him up?”</p><p>While the emotions did their rambling, my thoughts had somewhat regained little control over themselves. I could observe my surroundings again. As I was being led around in that empty space, I felt myself drifting. I didn’t know where I was going but I also didn’t give a care. I had never pictured how the outside felt like. After all, a spirit like me had only known cold and dark before. <br>Then, suddenly, I saw it. That bright blinding light. I could feel its embrace as I was leaving the cold darkness behind me. It was warm, full. Black’s counterpart, white was different. Nothing had been ever different, until then. My emotions, having experienced the view, the warmth, quieted down. They disappeared. But only for a moment, as the white light quickly dispersed. It only lasted for a short while.</p><p>Colours. Their turn had come. They replaced the white and black, as both of them left my vision. The colours hadn’t shown themselves one by one though. They were together. I could see their shapes, their lines. The emotions gave me a visit again. For some reason I tried to reject them as they had once taken control over me. But oddly enough, they seemed more and more interesting. I decided to listen while they continued their fight.</p><p>“Hurray! We’re free,” repeated the chanting one. The reluctant one wasn’t so sure. “I am not sure about this. Let’s go back.” Little did he know that it was already too late. We were freed and there was no going back to point zero.</p><p>“Don’t get agitated, guys. We need to judge the situation,” said one of the feelings. As usual, no one headed his words, as they rushed for action. “Let’s go! Let’s go! Let’s go!”</p><p>The crying one sobbed, “Waaaah!”</p><p>It was the outside world. Time was flowing there. It was full of shapes and colours yet unknown to me. There was so much knowledge to gain, too many things to explore. I could feel myself being fuelled by the emotions while they pranced and screamed aloud. It was the end of my boring old self who only knew what cold and dark meant.<br> <br>I felt the motions, the vibrations. I was free, out of my cell.</p><p>Or so I had thought.</p>

                <p>I cooked the steaks in my tent. Filet mignon, since we had to butcher the pig anyway. <br>My date arrives. I used my water ration today to wash my hair. I am wearing a dress. Taken from an abandoned house in a previous town. It's a slinky red dress but I didn't want to ruin the mood so I am barefoot. My boots outside the tent flat. He smells nice too when I hug him hello. He waves the bottle of vodka he is carrying. I suggest Martinis. Shaken not stirred. He pours us both a drink. I only have 2 of my precious candles burning and the tent is dimly lit. My gown drags the ground as I set the table for us. We have our steaks, apples and Martinis. I ask him if he wants the steak first? Because I know we will have to save something for breakfast. We are rationing our food over 24 hour periods. He approves of the steak and comments that it smells wonderful. His attention is torn between looking at my barely covered boobs and the steak I just sat in front of him. I understand. <br>After dinner. We play a Phil Collins cd on the hifi using one of our precious batteries. We slowly dance around the small confines of the tent. <br>In this desolate world we now inhabit, the comfort of his arms has given me a brief respite from reality. I ask him to stay the night. He hesitates. He says he's impotent. I stop swaying to the music. I back out of his arms. With sad eyes I ask him to leave. He starts to wrap his leftover steak. I tell him he can't have that. He picks up the bottle of vodka. I say he can't have the rest of that either. His shoulders hunched he walks toward the tent opening. He says goodbye in a forlorn voice. So forlorn that I almost change my mind, I mean really, he could do things for me....but no. It would be unfair. <br>Later that night I open my eyes to a noise in my tent. It's him. Leaning over my bed. Oh just fucking great. The walls were breached and my former almost one night stand is back. It seems he is not impotent now. Kinda hot too. He drags me out of bed. But no, that is no way to think. Sigh. Big heavy sigh. I really want to get laid. He continues to drag me by one leg. I mean, come on. He was just turned. Sex is sex. I scrabble back against the table and knock the knife off onto the floor. The knife I used to cut my steak. It was only in the heat of passion it tasted so good. Honestly it was a little dry. I grab the knife and just miss it! He continues to drag me out the tent flap. I ponder the stars as I am dragged along. He drags me into another tent. And drops my leg. He growled in a voice filled with glass. "I am tired of being impotent"<br>I reply back in my own broken voice "Dear. It doesn't work if I'm frigid" <br>I stand up and embrace my lover. Who still wants to play my games. We tear and rip at our borrowed clothes. There is plenty more in this deserted town. Along with the fallen clothes are several small strips of skin. Hazard of the games. <br>Love is love in any form.</p>

                <p><strong>For VirgZK</strong></p><p>Dark The Raven</p><p>Virg the great is immortal. His curiosity has led him to travel the world and he has seen sights untold. The beauties of the world that generally goes unnoticed by the mortals that inhabit this wonderful place. Each season Mother Nature in all her glory drapes herself in the jewels of nature. Just looking makes his soul ache. And he has witnessed the devastation man can wreck on not only Gods bounty but on themselves. He has been called by many names. Raven King, Dark Lord....Dark The Raven is the one that seems to stick the longest. Immortality means he usually walks alone. Yet, he has two fellow travelers. To call them "pets" insults both Virg and his companions. <br>Two large ravens.</p><p>When the ravens chose to wander with him, Huginn and Muninn were given several gifts by Virg. The ability to speak and the ability to see as well as Virg at night. Huginn was also given the special gift of thought. The insight to see and understand motivations. Muninn's gift was the ability of mind. The insight to see the ramifications of things that could and could not be changed. At night both ravens leave Virg and roam the world. This in itself was another gift given the 2 ravens. Ravens have notoriously bad night vision but Virg’s gift gave them a whole new world to explore. Huginn and Muninn soared and rode the wild wind currents. It satisfied their souls.</p><p>A lot of ravens in the 13th century had simple needs, Survival, food, mating. Some aspired to be picked to join the elite death squads. If accepted they would be scouts and seekers, and like the other creatures that were part of the Death Squads. Immortal. <br>These were men/demons/creatures wearing black hooded cloaks, riding soot black horses with huge black dogs loping beside them.</p><p>They rove in packs of 12. Their hoods covered their heads and kept their faces hidden in deep shadow.</p><p>Their intentions were to punish the wicked. Abolish the unnatural.</p><p>They rode almost without sound. Only the creak of the saddles, the hooves of the horses. The dogs did not bay until a prey was in sight. The horses did not whinny or snort. They all knew their missions were to meet and conquer death.</p><p>To see a Death Squad riding meant death was near. Rare was the man or woman that lived to tell of seeing one ride by. In years past people knew that if they heard a squad close by they were to lie down and cover their ears. They squeezed their eyes closed and fervently whispered prayers. Any prayers would do. As long as the litany drowned out the creaks of saddles and the light pounding of hooves. To peek was to draw their attention. And simple people that wanted to live simple lives hid their faces so they could live to tell the tale of how close death had touched them.</p><p>After a time the tales of the Death Squads became lore. Generations passed and they were not seen. Or rather, there was no one that lived to tell the tale of seeing them.</p><p>Virg, The Dark Raven, was in a town he stumbled across a week before. He had just arrived in the country and was intrigued when he heard of the uprising of the undead. <br>It was a desert shantytown with heavily fortified gates. During this era Virg dressed as a gunslinger. His pistols low and tied to his thighs. His pockets full of precious bullets. It amused him to play at being human. Even an out of date one. The townspeople although leery of him, welcomed him in. He listened with interest to the stories of fighting for their lives from these "zombies" His companions; Huginn and Muninn remained perched close by. Heads cocked and listening. After a light meal of stew, Virg settled down. He asked his companions to scout that night to see how bad it really was. Assuming the townspeople had exaggerated quite a bit.</p><p>At about 1 am he awoke to the sounds of shuffling and moaning on the other side of the wall. Although fear was foreign to him, the sound gave him almost a visceral feeling. He needed to see the creatures that made such hungry sounds.</p><p>He scaled the wall and looked down at the mass of rotting corpses before him, 1000s of them! <br>He had heard of similar creatures when he was a young God. The undead had killed millions. It crossed continents. It was genocide for some races. But the Death Squads had rode at night to abolish the hordes! He thought this might equal that hellish time. The flutter of wings beside him was a relief. He climbed back down to ground level and leaning his back against the wall listened as his companions said the hordes outside the walls were everywhere. Surrounding all camped villagers.</p><p>He apologized to his bird friends but requested another errand of them. He wanted them to call on the Death Squads.</p><p>The town was quietly jubilant the next morning. No deaths.</p><p>Virg, although new to the town had a suggestion. <br>He asked the townspeople to remain in their tents that night. He indicated he had asked for help and they needed reassurance that they were not observed. The townspeople looked confused but agreed after many reassurances. Virg was very compelling and comforting.</p><p>That night at midnight Virg again climbed the wall. His companions again soon settled beside him. They returned with the news they had made contact with 3 death squads. Although not one had verbally agreed to help they would make their decision known.<br>The Death Squad rarely spoke. And then in only riddles.</p><p>The zombies pushed on the barricaded walls. Virg could feel the wall shake. The moaning and animalistic chatter below him took on an almost gleeful tone. Virg began to second-guess his decision to send the townspeople to bed</p><p>Huginn cawed. He stared out in to the stillness beyond the mass of inhumanity below the wall on which they clung.</p><p>Virg saw the dark shapes racing towards the town. He also saw 2 more sets racing from other directions. The relief he felt that the Death Squads were coming to help these people in the buttressed walls was an almost primitive emotion.</p><p>The riders along with the black dogs as big as horses themselves began tearing into the zombies. The Death Squads scimitars rose and fell. It did not seem the undead felt pain. There were no screams or even efforts to defend themselves, which should be an instinctive human thing to do. But yet again, a sign of the zombies inhumanity.</p><p>Virg stayed on the wall and bore witness. These were loving breathing people at one time. Someone needed to mourn them, even as they suffered an inhumane death.</p><p>Once the last zombie fell. A lone rider rode to the wall Virg perched on. The rider raised his face and Virg saw only a white chin. A gravely voice that sounded as if he had swallowed broken glass spoke in the tongue of the lost language of the ancient Norse German.</p><p>"This pestilence that has scoured this country will soon be over. The living will see many more dead before that day. The toll will be heavy. We will ride every night until then"</p><p>Virg bowed his head in respect. So did his companions.</p><p>The man/creature continued. <br>"Don't make a mouse of yourself, or else you will be eaten by cats."</p><p>Virg frowned slightly. What did he mean?</p><p>Virg replied. <br>"It is too much to expect of a cat that he should sit by the milk and not lap it?"</p><p>The reply was even more confusing. <br>"There are more ways of killing a cat than choking it with cream."</p><p>Once again Virg replied<br>"To catch rats the cats take off their gloves"</p><p>The man bowed his hooded head in honor. He turned his horse and rode away with his squad following.</p><p>Virg climbed down the wall. Not on the inside but on the outer wall.</p><p>He walked over and around the dead. He headed out into the desert.</p><p>The next morning the townspeople awoke to the site of the undead bodies. And to the newcomer, Virg, missing.</p><p>Thus began another legendary tale of Virg's strength and courage. Killing a 1000 undead single-handedly. Then mysteriously disappearing as he had mysteriously appeared.</p><p>Meanwhile the Death Squads rode nightly. Saving mankind when they couldn't save themselves. Until the world was once again cleansed. By abolishing the unnatural creatures man had made.</p>

Nearly running into Uncle Solo. He reached out and caught my shoulders. <br>"Slow down young buck!" He laughed. <br>"Uncle Solo!" I cried. "The council members sent me to tell you to answer your cellphone."<br>I had never seen the florid faced council member that had grabbed my arm so distressed before.</p><p>Uncle Solo, Soloman Jebs, was Mayor of Astorville. Everyone agreed he was the wisest man in the City. Except...he hated phones. Called them too invasive. He liked a messenger to bring him news.</p><p>Unfortunately today, everyone was in the council rooms at City Hall and I was grabbed to get Uncle Solo. <br>Uncle Solo quizzed me about what the problem was but I had no idea.</p><p>I asked if I could ride with him the short distance back to the park where I had been playing. <br>He agreed and away we went.</p><p>Once we reached city hall he reminded me to be home for dinner.</p><p>I had lived with Uncle Solo my entire life. My parents had died in a car accident and Uncle Solo was my only relative. My life was filled with great stories and fun filled days.</p><p>I ran across the street to the park.</p><p>Hunh, strange. The friends I had played with before running home were gone.</p><p>I hesitated only briefly before running back to City Hall.</p><p>I entered the complex to find it seemingly deserted. I lightly made my way to my Uncle's office. Behind his desk there was an old fashioned air vent. The kind with a lattice faceplate. I knew from previous visits that I could hear everything from the main conference room. I stifled a laugh. If Uncle Solo only knew.</p><p>There were raised voices in the room. It was hard to distinguish who was who. Except Uncle Solo. He was calm. He had a deep and commanding voice. Yet reassuring too. <br>"Gentlemen! Calm down. Let's sit."</p><p>There was more shuffling and noise. Then chairs being pulled out.</p><p>The voices rose again. My Uncle called for quiet and then asked one member to give an accounting. <br>"Solomon. We have a great problem. One of the children is missing. He was taken from his home last night"</p><p>My stomach felt funny. All twisty. I leaned closer to the vent.</p><p>Uncle Solo questioned the man.</p><p>He went on to say that the child had been put to bed and was missing from his room in the morning. He was only 7 years old. <br>There were murmurings. "Only 7. Only 7 years old...not 10"</p><p>I was 9 years old. Why was 7 so important?</p><p>Uncle asked if any parents were missing? <br>Another strange question.</p><p>The man answering the questions said not all had been accounted for. I realized it was the Police of Chief answering the questions.</p><p>I was sure the boy would show up for a scolding. Why such a fuss?</p><p>Just then there was a tremendous commotion.</p><p>I jumped!</p><p>The noise in the conference room was jubilant.</p><p>A child was crying.</p><p>I felt a loosening in my chest. The boy was returned. I wondered who it was. And decided right there I would be nice to him at school so he wouldn't be picked on for going missing. Whoever it was...</p><p>There was talk again.</p><p>I heard a woman crying. 2 women.</p><p>Uncle Solo asked one woman what happened.</p><p>Her voice was strident.</p><p>She said she needed the boy. That she was sick. That her husband was weak.</p><p>Did she need him for chores I thought?</p><p>The other mother screamed. An unearthly scream. How dare this woman take her child. She had already used her own child up!</p><p>What did that mean? "Up"</p><p>Uncle called for quiet. The child kept crying softly.</p><p>Uncle told the first woman that she had put them into a bad situation. That now she would have to take the child home with her. He asked the Chief of Police to stand.</p><p>The second mother screamed.</p><p>"No. She doesn't deserve anything. She stole him"</p><p>Uncle said "We all signed a contract a long time ago. None would go without. It is all of our fault the woman and her husband were without. We didn't have a child ready for them"</p><p>He continued "We have two options. The first is to give the child to her. Since the child is already traumatized"</p><p>Give the child to the first woman? What?</p><p>"Or divide the child between you."</p><p>I suddenly realized why everyone said my Uncle was so wise. Of course divide the child. He would have 2 sets of parents and be loved twice as much.</p><p>There was more talk. Some raised voices and low weeping.</p><p>But it was agreed that the child would be divided. The second mother insisted she would not do without. <br>The child's voice was heard "Mom?"</p><p>I won't describe what I heard next. Or mention the vomit I left on the floor. The screams I stifled. <br>I don't remember the run home. To the only place I felt safe. My room.</p><p>But I am waiting for my aged uncle. The man who looks a 1000 years old.</p><p>I am hugging my knees. <br>My bowels loosen when I hear a step on the stairs.</p><br><p>Of note. Solomon prayed for wisdom. And he was granted it. But he also exiled 10,000s of people in a form of genocide.<br>I hope I have not offended anyone with this version of a modern day undead Solomon.</p>

                <p>I am so glad you liked it. I hated killing a child.</p><p>And no. I have a germ of an idea and write it out in one go. I actually wrote this in the hour after I spoke to you last but was troubled by it. So I postponed actually publishing it. The stories I write are all free flowing so I never know which direction they will turn. Sorry i didn't make you a hero.</p>
