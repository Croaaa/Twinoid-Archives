                <p>Some time ago, we found out that one of our number, <span class="tid_user tid_user_399034 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="399034">ironman70mc</span> had passed away, thanks to some excellent detective work by <span class="tid_user tid_user_698824 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="698824">Paulsen</span>.</p><p>N&amp;C/TCO put our heads together and decided to make a tribute of some sort to Ironman, who had been part of our team for a long time. <br>Ironman70mc was an integral member of our team, and did so much to help organise and entertain everyone in each town.</p><p>His personal catchphrase was "<strong>TEAMWORK</strong>", and as such, we figured a perfect way to remember him was to do just that - teamwork, in the form of a wonder town.</p><p>So here it is, <span class="tid_user tid_user_399034 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="399034">ironman70mc</span>, Your wonder town - <strong>Somber Lodge of the Uninvited</strong>, We built you a Giant Sandcastle, a Wonderwheel, and finally a Reactor for a viking funeral pyre.</p><p>In the Citizens Home next to town we erected an Iron Lair for you as well, filled it with almost everything from our bank: <a href="http://imgur.com/lmrUyop" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/lmrUyop</a> and gathered out there for a moments silence.</p><p>My hat goes off to everyone in this town, we did what we set out to do, and did it well. Wherever you are now <span class="tid_user tid_user_399034 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="399034">ironman70mc</span>, hope you like it mate. Peace out.</p>

                <p>He was one of the first players I met on die2nite, all the way back in season 1; and as entertaining as to have me remember him to this day. In fact, one of the players of the town wrote up an RP of that town. Figure I should share it here, for any friends of his who might be interested.</p><p><strong>A RP By Bigdaddyman</strong></p><p><em>Isabelle walked out of her well built hovel and looked around. Several of the other citizens were up, moving about. <br>"It looks like the defenses held." she thought to herself.<br>Moving closer to the gates, the smell of death and rotting flesh simply overpowered the senses. Climbing up to the search tower, she could see why. Hundreds of zombies piled on top of each other, dead, literally climbing over one another trying to get inside. <br>"It looks like we had just enough."<br>"You can say that again." Magnificus added, if there were fifty more, wed all be dead."<br>Isabelle looked into the distance, hoards of the hungry dead walking and shuffling about.<br>"Five to six hundred tonight. Maybe more." Magnificus said, reading her mind. "It would appear we did some damage." <br>She turned back to face the town. Several other citizens were piecing together the destroyed defenses from last nights attack. Argonopolis and Norb were rebuilding the heap of rubbish that stopped around seventy-five zeds. Necrophiliac spent his early morning looking for some drugs, but water purifying tablets wont cut it. He then moved to help Dashing fix the stone cannon, which jammed near the end of the raid. IceEagle was coordinating efforts on new temporary defenses, hopefully they would give them one more night.<br>"Go check on Ellivision, haven't seen him all day." Magnificus said, turning once more to the World Beyond. "Come up with something quickly Isabelle, time is scarce."<br>Isabelle walked down to the living area and dropped the bucket into the well. All that came up was a muddy soup of dirt and god knows what else. She sighed and drank it quickly, there was no more. She passed by a house, where a drowsy Alister walked out and smiled. At least he could smile today, more than could be said of her.<br>Isabelle knocked on Ellivision's door, and he quickly answered.<br>"Oh, hey Isa, whats up?"<br>"Oh, I just wanted to check up on you, make sure your OK."<br>Ellivision smiled, "After your quick thinking last night, were all doing OK."<br>IronMan70mc tried to fight the sunlight by rolling over, but it forced his eyes to open and wake up. Despite everything that happened, he really didn't know if he had one more day in him. He heard a call for everyone to meet in the town center, and quickly got up. Isabelle likely had some crackpot plan or Necrophiliac was yelling at everyone for drugs, but either way, he had to go. Opening the door, he met Dymlos15, still infuriated at being dragged back to the town last night just before the attack. Obviously he planned on dying, lucky him. <br>Ironman70mc quickly looked over to the right where he saw Kooh and Nasus92 fighting over a battery launched which had just one shot. Either way they would likely die tonight. One shot would only be good for a final F*** you to one lucky Zed.<br>On his way to the town center, he saw Saucyemmettc, what a name, working on a hovel. He would try to last out the night, but a hovel wouldn't make any difference.<br>Ironman70mc stopped by the workshop on his way, where leadfarmer and arkvoodle were trying to convert everything they could with the hacksaw and factory tools. They made plank after plank and forged the iron, all in a desperate attempt to make it one more night.<br>But that was all they had, all they could get. One more safe night. Would it happen?<br>Ironman70mc reached the town center, where nearly everyone had gathered. Isabelle was on top of a large box, preparing her speech, plan, or whatever else she had come up with. Ironman70mc sat down and closed his eyes. Would any of this really matter?<br>"OK, now I know everyone is nervous and scared, but we have to try something tonight. It looks like a few more zed are coming this way as compared to last night, but I believe we can stop them and get to tomorrow. We need one more set of nuts and bolts and we can get the ramparts done. With that, we can make sure that everyone is safe tonight. So I really need all of you to work together and come forward with anything you may have that could be useful. Is everyone understanding?"<br>Chatter broke out and people conversed amongst themselves. Amerame came forward and gave a brilliant idea to use the grenades in the armory to set up land mines for incomning Zed.<br>DarkPenguin alerted the town to the fact that they could make torches to lead the zombies into the minefield.<br>Sharkfin told them to use as much of the wood and iron as they could to make a zombie shredder, a devious invention planning on turning zombies into grated cheese.<br>Isabelle walked over to Ironman70mc, one of the three citizens who had proven himself to be a hero.<br>"I think we can do this. Skaliton is a little worried but everyone is working hard on tonights defenses... Wait... have you see BigDaddyMan? He wasn't at the meeting was he?"<br>"No, I didn't, but last night he was acting a little strange and slurring his words. Probably drank to get a quick infusion of energy."<br>A worried look crossed her face, "I hope thats all he did...."<br>Staggering to his feet, BigDaddyMan could barely stand. Not only did that Vodka pound in his head like a Mac Truck, the last thing he did before passing out near the wall was... No, no one could know.<br>Trying to walk, he faltered and stumbled his way towards the well. A little water would do him some good. He dropped the bucket in and heard a solid thud. Nothing. He forced his way to the bank, hopefully some of the food was left. Anything would be better than this. Tired and weak, he practically crawled his way there. Thankfully, one of his well cooked meals was still here. Brushing away the flies he devoured it, energy slowly returning to him. He also grabbed a battery launched and some rounds. Where he was going, he would need them.<br>BigDaddyMan didn't know how he would explain this to the town, especially if they made it one more night. This wouldn't end well. He quietly moved near the center of town, where Isabelle was giving her daily plan. Heh, she was a goddess among men, the only female inhabitant here, and the only one you didn't want to cross.<br>He sneakily moved past and headed to the workshop, which was quiet. No one was inside. He grabbed a wooden spike, it was the last thing he could think of as far as protection. Amerame mad several of these yesterday in the hopes of protecting the town in the event the gates fell. Trying to be stealthy, he managed to knock over several stacks of scrap metal, likely alerting everyone in town to his presence.<br>BigDaddyMan walked out through the back door, where DarKPenguin was waiting.<br>"Everyone is worried about you, where have you been?"<br>Avoiding eye contact, BigDaddyMan moved past him and headed for the gates.<br>"Thats none of your concern. Im going out."<br>"Isabelle has shut the gates and wont open them without a good reason... Your going to have to go through her."<br>"Damnit! Ugh, I cant do this Dark, I need you to get me out without a scene."<br>"A scene? Why would you cause a scene when you go scavenging."<br>BigDaddyMan turned to face him, fully revealing the truth.<br>"My God, what DID you do?"<br>"What I had to... let me out."<br>"She wont let you out now."<br>"Well see."<br>BigDaddyMan pushed on towards the town center, where mostly everyone still remained. Isabelle spotted him and DarkPenguin and rushed over.<br>"You missed my big speech. Where were you, we were worried."<br>"You mean YOU were worried," BigDaddyMan said, eyes glued to the dirt.<br>"Well, yes... But, whats wrong?"<br>Before he had time to respond, Necrophiliac came rushing up and slugged BigDaddyMan square in the jaw.<br>"You son of a bitch! You took them! What did you do with them."<br>BigDaddyMan struggled to his feet and turned to face the desert.<br>"I don't have them."<br>Necrophiliac grabbed him by the back of the neck and threw him down, "Your lying!" he yelled as he began to punch and kick him.<br>DarkPenguin and Magnificus wrestled him off and threw him aside. Standing between Necrophiliac and BigDaddyMan, they refused to let him through.<br>Isabelle carefully took a cloth and wiped the blood away from his face. She looked into his eyes and everything made sense. By now most of the town had gathered, and Necrophiliac took his place in front of them.<br>"He took the last of our drugs! He used them! After chastising me and all of you for using them, he took them! A hypocrite!"<br>The citizens began to get angry, lack of water and food caused them to be irrational.<br>"Why did you do this? Are you mad?" Isabelle asked sternly, "Your going to die now, thats not... we cant..."<br>BigDaddyMan stood to his feet and faced the angry citizens.<br>"Alright, listen to me. All of you! I did this because I HAD too! Last night, we were so unprepared that if I didn't stay up all night fixing half the damn defenses and upgrading the walls, all of YOU would be dead! Don't you dare get on my back for doing the only thing that would save the lot of you! I will die now, but not here, not this way. Im going out into the desert, and Im not coming back. So there you go."<br>BigDaddyMan swung the large gates open and walked into the scalding sun. There was more to come, but only time will tell...<br></em></p>

                <p><em>The sun was blazing, but only had a few hours before it set. BigDaddyMan walked on, no water, no food, nothing. Only his trusty machete by his side, battery launcher strapped to his belt, and wooden spike on his back. He knew it was suicide, but what other option did he have? Die by cowering in a hovel or taking down as many zed as possible to help preserve the town. Heh. They called him a hero, they called him a scavenger, defender, scout, all of these things. But in truth he was no different from them. Scared, hell, more like terrified. Ever stare down death in the face? Its hard to walk away without fear.<br>The zed didn't move during the day, Whether this was the sun or something else, BigDaddyMan didn't know. South he went, moving past packs of zed who stared at him hungrily but didn't budge. He kept one hand on the machete, ready for anything. He passed by one of the buildings where he took a quick rest. Inside it was empty, but the shade provided some comfort. The sun would likely set in three hours, he had to lure more Zed south of the town.<br>They would call him a hypocrite, they would call him a coward, they would call him a doom-sayer. They were all right, but he was also a Hero, and that still meant something to people. He could only hope no one followed him into the sands. Peeking out of the hut, the sun briefly stinging his eyes, he could see nothing but zed and sand. Time to move on.<br>The sun beat intensely and unforgivably as time pressed on. Two hours till the Zed would begin to move, and feast. He had to keep going farther south.<br>IronMan70mc oversaw the remaining construction for the day, making sure that Mount Kilimanjaro, as it had been nicknamed got built, as well as some emergency defenses and spiky traps. There was nothing they really could do with so few resources. Time was running out, and zed were ready to move. The Plate Gun was a nice new addition that made use of the Semtex in the armory. He could've swore they had 3 last night, but only found two today. Nevertheless, it got the job done.<br>Skaliton teamed up with Norb and quickly assembled the new cannon, amazed at how effective it was. It just might rain zombies tonight. Amerame was setting up the spikes he made last night to create a wall of spears. He laughed at how many zed would plough into them tonight. IceEagle was the defacto resource manager, giving items where they were needed and alerting everyone to just how much they had left. He was quite a leader. Dashing was doing what he does best, running needed items to and from construction sites. DarKPenguin and Nasus92 were keeping the workshop busy, turning all the leftover resources into usable resources. Saucyemmettc was trying desperately to dig the well deeper for more water. They were all dehydrated, but the well was gone, and the water was dry. If they managed to last one more night, they would all die in the morning from lack of water.<br>Ellivision was handing out the last of the food, they had exactly 20 rations left, one for everyone, well, everyone that was here. Some citizens didn't even touch it, like Kooh, claiming thats its just more reasons for the zed to eat them.<br>Ironman70mc walked over and encouraged everyone to keep fighting, it wasn't the end, not yet. leadfarmer tried to make everyones meals better by letting them use his special stash of salt, but it wasn't much help. Argonopolis decided it was better that he spend his lunch finishing the minefield and prepping the torches.<br>Alister, arkvoodle, and Dymlos15 created a very crafty device using a belt that would fling objects at the hordes of zed. Quite a build.<br>Magnificus brought Isabelle's meal to her, who hadn't budged from the town gates since he left. He set it down on the box in front of her and sat down as well.<br>"He's wont come back. You know that. Hes a man of his word, and after last night, I don't think half the town wants him back."<br>"The town..." she scoffed, "What the hell do they know? Ive been working my ass off so they could have a place to live. What do we get in return? Anger, hatred, insults... No wonder he left."<br>"Well, lack of water and food will turn citizens against each other."<br>"You mean like Necrophiliac? I swear I'd kill him myself, but... it doesn't matter. None of it does."<br>Magnificus placed a machete on the box next to her food, "He left this one for you. Wanted you to use it somehow to save the town. I don't know what he was thinking, but he did it all for you."<br>"Why me? What have I done to deserve this?"<br>"Are you kidding Isabelle? If not for you we'd all be dead."<br>She looked at the bowl of food, obviously spoiled, and grabbed the machete. She stood and headed for the bank.<br>"Where are you going?" Magnificus asked.<br>"To bring him back..." <br><br><br>Thirty minutes, that was all they had left. Everyone stood on the walls looking out over the desert, wondering when they would move. Norb clutched the Plate Guns firing switch, ready to blast them to hell, where Amerame controlled the Stone Cannon. Dymlos15 and arkvoodle loaded the catapults and readied it for launch. The had several spiky balls of metal that would crush tons of zed. Alister held the small compact detonator, ready to let the land mines go, blowing millions of zed away. Saucyemmettc readied the last few batteries into the Breaker and set it spinning. It would last a good few hours and pummel any zed that got close. Sharkfin carefully aimed the Devastator towards the open desert. Anything that got in their way would get a battery between the eyes. Kooh readied the hacksaw in one hand and the penknife in the other. Anything that got through this door would get it. Dashing assured that any leftover materials made it in front of the main gates, quickly, and set it up to prevent as many zeds from tearing it down as possible, using duct tape and anything else that was sticky. Nasus92 and Skaliton were ready for anything, standing tall with their flaming torches in each hand. They would slow the zed down at least. Ellivision revved up the chainsaw he found earlier in the desert, the favored weapon in close range, things were going to get 'dicey'. Argonopolis clutched the water pistol in his hands tightly, still amazed he found it with water still in it. Most people would try and drink it, but he was ready to burn some zed. DarKPenguin readied the baseball bat in one hand, and the loaded pistol in the other. How he managed to find ANY bullets still amazed him, but more importantly, he had 12 shots to go before the bat would be needed. IceEagle, like a leader, stood in front of everyone, carefully aiming the newly constructed Battery Launcher MK-II in hand. This new device made it so that the gun could fire other object and even crushed batteries. He had a satchel full of ammo and two fresh batteries to go. Nothing was getting in. Ironman70mc looked out from the watchtower, they were beginning to move. Time was up. This was it. Magnificus placed a hand on his shoulder.<br>"Let's do this."<br></em></p>

                <p><em>BigDaddyMan looked around, the sun nearly past the horizon. Only a few moments before the zed would be mobile, and he would be inclined to defend himself, let he be killed by hungry zombies. Thinking back, it wasn't perhaps the smartest decision leaving, but now he didn't have a choice to turn back. He lit a torch he found in a smaller house back a ways, drank the water ration and ate the can of beans he found as well. The house was boarded up and nearly untouched. Too bad it was found this late. The last light of the sun faded, and the hordes were unleashed upon the world. With machete in hand and torch in the other, BigDaddyMan couldn't help but wonder how many would be coming after him. Minutes passed, and zed gathered around him, snapping and moaning, eager to tear his flesh apart.<br>BigDaddyMan looked around, realized he was surrounded, and readied the Semtex he snuck out of the armory this morning. He pulled the pin, and let it fly, much to the chagrin of the zed.<br>With a loud boom, zed went flying everywhere, and the rest lept at him. BigDaddyMan forced the pain of withdrawal behind him and sidestepped the horde. The machete ripped into flesh, severing limbs and throwing putrid blood everywhere. A craft zed tried to sneak up on him, but he just slammed the torch into its skin, setting the beast alight. Thankfully, the torch still burned. With more light, he could accurately determine the number of zed. He smirked, more than enough. He threw the torch into the face of another zed, setting a nearby tree on fire. With the battle fully illuminated, he grabbed the ITF from his side and sent a battery perfectly through the skulls of 10 zed, amazed that it had that much power. He angrily sliced his way through zed after zed, becoming quickly fatigued. Suddenly, as he brought the machete across the side of a nearby zombies head, the machete shattered into several pieces. He dropped the hilt and took the cumbersome wooden spike off his back.<br>"Gotta do it the hard way eh? Your up first Zed..."<br>The citizens were locked in fear, watching the mass of zed pour down upon them like a flood. As soon as they crossed the point, Alister let the mines go, blowing the entire front line of zeds away like a firework show. An arm landed on poor Norb's head, and almost caused him to prematurely fire the cannon. Thankfully, he regained his composure and pulled the trigger when the time was right. The Plate Gun burst with a display not seen by anyone here, sending multiple balls of steel strapped with Semtex into the horde. They burst, ripping into the zombies and leaving two huge holes in their line. The three Stone Cannons ripped and thudded, sending three huge boulders rolling at the mass of zeds. Those that survived this encounter met the breakers. They smashed and broke zed in half, nearly wiping out a hundred. The batteries drained faster than predicted and the Breakers soon stopped completely. Nearly three hundred zed down, the broken ranks hit the temporary defenses and the moat. Zed screamed as they were bathed in fresh water, ripping their putrid flesh from their bones. Mount Kilimanjaro did its dues and zed simply fell down and could no longer walk, combined with the grater, zed simply were ripped to shreds. The catapult fired, sending a very large ball of metal rolling into the front line of zed, taking out a large portion of the middle. By the time the zombies hit the old school traps and spiked pit, things were looking up, but when the second wave came, they all knew this was it.<br>They all slammed into the gate, gnashing and ripping, trying their best to tear off the sheets of metal and wood that barred them entrance. To the left and right of the gate, more zed flowed, climbing over one another. The towns center was lit with torches and there they stood. 19 citizens ready to destroy anything. Ironman70mc stood strong, clutching the last two weapons in his hand, the mighty mobile phone of old, and the Exploding water bomb, a late find. Everyone stood ready as the gates began to buckle. The zed finally got in, the gate smashing open, and in they came.<br><br>Kooh, Nasus92, Skaliton, and Ellivions rushed forward, their melee weapons tightly gripped, and hit the zed horde face first. Kooh severed two zombies head with his hacksaw, then sank the knife into the skull of another. Spinning in circles the zed trying to get to him met the edge of the saw. Slightly dizzy, he fell, and before he could get back up, they were all over him. <br><br>Nasus92 and Skaliton set every zed they could on fire and continued their pursuit of flaming glory. When the torches went out however, they used them as clubs. They killed many zed, but the sticks broke and they too fell to the might of the horde. <br><br>Ellivision stood strong, chainsaw humming beautifully. The zed hesitated, and he dashed forward, the saw cutting flesh like butter. The zed screamed and massed around him, but the weapon was too much. No zed could even get close before becoming chunks of meat. The chainsaws battery faltered and it stopped for a moment. One zed nearly got him, but DarKPenguin put a round through its skull. He stood by Ellivision, blowing zed's heads off with the pistol. The chainsaw hummed again with a fresh battery, and the two managed to knock down nearly a hundred zed. Unfortunately, the batteries died and they too were consumed in the mass.<br><br>During this time, Sharkfin had blew 5 zombies heads off with the amazing devastator, and continued in the fun by launching rocks and other items. Each one got multiple zombies per shot. Dashing was watching his back, using a torch to keep zed back, and handing Sharkfin anything that could be shot. Out of ammo and fire, these two brave souls were engulfed and devoured.<br><br>Argonopolis held the line with the water pistol, trying to shoot as many as he could, conserving water each and every time. Alister watched his back with one of the only weapons left he could find, a screwdriver. The pistol flamed zed after zed, causing them to run in agony and most fall down with no more face. Alister stabbed a zombie directly in the skull with the screwdriver and looked around, thinking quickly. He grabbed a old microwave oven and beat zed after zed over the head with it. By now, the water pistol had run dry, and the oven smashed into a hundred pieces. These two simply let the horde come. <br><br>Saucyemmettc simply went crazy with anything he could get his hands on, even using other zed as a weapon. Unfortunately for him, despite being thrown into a crowd, zombies are still hungry, and Saucyemmettc bit it. <br><br>Norb broke into the chest, formerly locked by Isabelle, marked "Use in dire situations ONLY!!". This counted. He cocked the 12 gauge and checked the ammo. Five, "just enough," he thought. Rushing from the home, he moved backwards towards the well and dropped to one knee. Zed came, and zeds died. Each shell ripping five or more zombies into a meaty pulp. The gun clicked, and Norb used it to knock some zed around. The death count was piling up, and Norb just added to it with his own. <br><br>Necrophiliac, formally hidden, came out to aid the town in his own way. Clutching five bottles of stashed vodka, turned into molitovs, and holding a nice box of matches, he knew exactly what needed to be done. He lit, threw, and repeated, until only one was left. Zed burned and burned, exploded, then burned some more. Necrophiliac gave one last laugh and the zed overpowered him. As they did this, he threw the last molitov up, and let the flames pave his way to the afterlife. <br><br>Leadfarmer and Dymlos15 stood ready, using two sharp metal poles as spears, impaling zombies left and right. This plan worked at keeping the zombies safely at a distance, but the spears soon became to heavy due to the zombies on them. They threw them with all their might and let the end come.<br><br>Amerame and Arkvoodle stood together, using a weapon of awesome destruction, the lawnmower. Moving the lawn fresh of zombies worked wonderfully, except for the fact that zombies can grab you from behind. A quick munch and they were gone as well.<br><br>The last three stood together, each ready in their own way. The mobile phone vibrated, and Ironman70mc threw it into the eye socket of a approaching zombie. The subsequent explosion nearly knocked them off their feet. A small crater was now where that zed stood, and many more were also gone. Magnificus pulled out the machine gun he'd been hiding for a long time, and let a hail of bullets fly. Zombies piled up as the rapid fire blew them away. IceEagle made it a fun endeavor, using the MK II to blast more zed than he thought possible. The guns clicked, and the zeds moved ever closer. Ironman70mc laughed, and the others joined in. The pulled the pin on the water bomb, and the three of them rushed forward together, bursting into a hail of fire and water.<br></em></p>

                <p><em>The spear ripped the zombie a new stomach, and BigDaddyMan quickly threw the zeds body off of it. Again and again, he used it like a ram to keep the zeds away. One got in behind and sank its teeth into his neck. Grabbing the zombie, he threw it over his shoulder and into a pack of other zombies, effectively killing two in the process. Filling a plastic bag with a second water ration he found in the last house, he chucked it at the nearest zed, killing four others in the process. It wasn't without fault, as a hungry zombie bit deep into the left arm. He knock the zeds head clean off with a powerful punch.<br>BigDaddyMan staggered backwards, without any weapons to keep him safe. He laughed, "I guess this is the way it ends..."<br>"Not yet it doesn't!"<br>That voice... his heart sank.<br>Isabelle came dashing in, slicing a path with the machete he left for her. She stood back to back, handing him a katana she found along the way.<br>"Tell me, when you decided to leave, did you realize I would follow you out here?" she said.<br>"Perhaps I did. Maybe I was hoping you had enough sense to stay back in the town." BigDaddyMan replied.<br>"The town is likely gone by now. You and I are the only ones left."<br>"Is that so? Then I better do this quick."<br>He turned and kissed her, then faced the zed army one more time. The two stood together, and here, in the end, The Unbalanced Counties, fell.<br></em></p>

At some point I agreed but I decided to troll him a bit - it took me a couple of minutes to come up with a childish depiction of an eager scavenger digging a hole in the wilds. It was meant to be a joke and I expected him to laugh about it and discard it, but instead he liked it anyway and even updated his profile picture.</p><p>It's not much of a story but I always smiled when I saw his name and avatar popping up in the forums. And so I did when I saw the card game you posted earlier. I think it's a great way to remember him.</p><p>I guess you could need a higher resolution version of the drawing, here it is: <a href="https://db.tt/iTU5Tbz2" target="_blank">https://db.tt/iTU5Tbz2</a><br>Feel free to use it.
