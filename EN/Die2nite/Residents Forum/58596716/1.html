                <p><strong>Days 1-9</strong></p><p><strong>Day 1:</strong><br>We woke up. But where are we? It's not part my apartament, but a dusty desert town! How do we appeared here? And who are these greenish things wanting to eat meat everytime when we meet them? Suspiciously they run from any drop of water we drop.</p><p><strong>Day 2:</strong><br>Lots of people just disappeared last night! What happened? And why greenish thingies are hitting our town wall with bare hands?! If we pour water at them, they are just... breaking into small parts! Green skin goes away from the body, like the rest! Nothing but dust, dry meat and bones are left on the ground.<br>I feel mystic powers filling me.</p><p><strong>Day 3:</strong><br>I like pigs. Nothing happened, air changed a little. It's more hot outside.<br>We saw that zombies are getting born from other zeds... that means we just need to kill all zombies to survive! Or one corner can be enough...?<br>Mystic powers don't allow me to sleep.</p><p><strong>Day 4:</strong><br>We are talking about piggies the whole day. Nobody notices two people lying somewhere under wall, dried by the sun. They died. We should give them some water, but we want to rather finish pig farm for future pigs ready, than waste water<br><strong><br>Day 5:</strong><br>One of fat citizens from Poland has found a lot of piggies lost in the desert! We have four stinky pinky piggies now! All hail pigs! I wanted to touch one, but they didn't allow to. What's wrong with them? At least people allowed me to invent some funky names for our piggies!</p><p><strong>Day 6:</strong><br>Someone has stolen Emmy, one of our pigs. When their owner was on expedition, thief sneaked into his house and... where is our little Emmy?! They all are suspecting me, but that wasn't me, god, how can I prove it?<br>We have finally ended making our corner zoo! Yayy!</p><p><strong>Day 7:</strong><br>Nothing interesting. Pigs are feeling good. I have no idea why almost all people are looking into my ceiling when they hear some pig-thingy sounds from it. There's nothing but few bottles of Winness and beer. If they want beer they can just say.<br>I have stolen Cat's paracetoid, why he needs it?<br>We've forgot about doing ruin runs. Wow, Hotel is only 7 km from us, we can explore it fast.</p><p><strong>Day 8:</strong><br>Another lost pig was found by Arturia! We named it Emily. I wanted "John", but oh well. She is with other pigs now, as Edeneric adopted her! All is going good, except that they want to shun me because of "Great Pig Abuse". I have no idea why.<br>Hey, Cat has paracetoid again. Let's steal it. It may be enough instead of water, as we have only 3 rations left in bank. God, help us.<br>Our hotel has unbeveliable amount of chairs inside. Like 10 or so. (Not so many *grins*)<br>We did today so many ruin ruins that we have forgot about souls. Only one wise person brought one to the town! We learnt that souls are important things, dead people can't live in the same world with alive! They makes zombies even more powerful thingies!</p><p><strong>Day 9:</strong><br>Oww! News from last day are horrible!<br>One of our helpful people has gone out to escort another citizen! But something really bad happened! Wild animals (e.g. wolf) closed the gates. No one was able to enter or leave town, due to portal lock built few days ago.<br>Both of them are dead now. The helpful and the lost.<br>We're dying because of dehydration. I am thinking about suicide.<br>Four souls are flying around me alone. They causes me a headache.<br><strong>Does anyone have a cyanide pill?</strong></p>
