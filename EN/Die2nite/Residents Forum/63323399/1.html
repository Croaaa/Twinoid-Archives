                <p>I think people should write a lil something about their town. <br><span class="tid_sideNote">One town we know lots about via WF- maybe up the anti and write an epic poem saga </span></p><p>Ill start. Reactor Pets town. Town #4</p><br><p>Day One. The apolcolypse was upon us so I packed up the old Jetta coalition and jumped in. Thankfully my conscience <span class="tid_user tid_user_2708656 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="2708656">Cocoche</span> ( I dont even know if hes real ) and <span class="tid_user tid_user_1798488 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1798488">Andrewmaniscool</span> , who proclaims himself as God were already on board. As soon as we pulled out of the driveway we saw a fornlorn Trashbaggy Hitchhiker. He told us his name was <span class="tid_user tid_user_622781 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="622781">ipharted</span> and he had been in and out of coalition-mobiles all week because he was a Jumper ( and No lie, it coulda been the smell) . But I personally love a lil man stench, so he fit right in and off we went to find a safe town. <br>We were caught in traffic outside Town # 3 for at least ten minutes after sadly realizing they were closing their gates. They were at capacity and turning townsfolk away. We could see friends waving at us . <br>I kinda felt like crying. I didnt want to travel farther to the fourth town. Noone likes the last town. But onward we went and it we rolled in when it was empty! .</p><p>We pulled into Reactionary Pits of the Damned and saw 4 people we have known in other towns and a bunch of familiar names and fresh faces. We all greeted each other warmly. Everyone was really cool! <span class="tid_sideNote">( cept for the one multi dude weird guy Shawn/Drake who has now deleted one of the accounts and still wont talk but I hope he helps if hes reading this ) and girl who hasnt logged in yet. grrr </span> We all went outside and danced in the wasteland and found neat things and enjoyed our two pages of threads Day 1. <span class="tid_sideNote">Yup thats right <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> 2 pages. love it </span> <br>Andrewman camped for the night outside and we worried a bit. but it worked out well! <br>We also had a raffle for LMS on day 1. LOL!</p><p>Day2-3 <br>We are super-human zombie killers! Our plan is to create a safe zone outside the walls. Our townspeople are awesome. We have created our most beautiful avatars to strut our stuff around town with. The "reactor Pets" have hit the ground running! <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> We have the best prize up for raffle at the moment too - <strong>an Iron Chest </strong>.</p>
