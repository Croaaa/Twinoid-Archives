Words on a piece of paper are immortal, never to be touched by the undead. And in this barren wasteland, God knows we need something immortal to watch over us right now.<br><br>I'm sitting inside a steel cage, the chair wonky at best, enjoying my last bottle of alcohol before my life ends. As I write this note, it's almost midnight. I can see it from the way the sands move. Midnight is hard to tell from late evening even on the best days, but I've lived long enough to be able to tell the difference.<br><br>If anybody finds this note, please know this: a man who is as good as dead can think up the strangest of thoughts. And the thought that I can't get off my head is: it is such a shame that my death will be for nothing. I understand the need for sacrifice, but it's sad that those who give up their lives for others are soon forgotten simply because nobody took up the pen to record their heroism.<br><br>That's why, if someone finds this and reads this, I ask you to keep this note and make it immortal. Pass it around. Spread the word: written works last forever, and if our bodies have to go down, I'll be damned if I let our legacies go down with it. There's more to a citizen than their bodies.<br><br>Zombies don't eat paper.<br><br>--unnamed author, name smeared in blood</cite></p><p>What a dreadful letter! <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_lol.gif" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>And thus, Write2Nite begins!

                <p>You're welcome. Oh, and you're link still fails. At least you just gave us the site link the old fashioned way! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Oh, here's that thing I was cooking up.</p><p>Hope you like.... It's a read.</p><p><strong>- - - - - - - -</strong></p><p><em>It beckoned him.</em></p><p>The citizen stared into the shack and his gaze was fixed upon one single item in the room that stood out from all the dust and dirt.</p><p>A tasty steak.</p><p>It made the citizen's mouth water as he licked his lips in anticipation for what was about to transpire. The plan had wiggled it's way into the brain of this citizen two nights ago..... The soul mates that had always traveled with him from town to town were already dead and haunting his very soul... But he could ignore their whispers, it was his seventh day in the town and it was already in chaos. Five of them were left, the other three were nothing but other citizens trying to uselessly build up the town by themselves in an attempt to hold back the horde.... No, the hero that was holding onto the best looking food the citizen had seen in the past seven days had written in a small scribbled note on how the Scout would open the gates and let the zombies in to feast on the flesh of the weaker citizens... While the Scout safely hid in the shack and did what Scout's normally did, remain unnoticed to the zombies.</p><p>However, the Scout's note came into the citizen's possession via the back pocket of the Scout's uniform.... You see, this particular Citizen was a practiced thief. He would practice on stealing radio's and sometimes the odd wad of cash that people put in their room, pretending to be liveing in the past and forget about the zombie's no doubt, and after some time.... He had nearly perfected the art.</p><p>It was true that it was an art, he always needed to use all of his cunning when stealing. He had once managed to steal a funny looking green pill some Shaman said was steroids while the said Shaman was asleep on his camp bed.</p><p>The Scout had made the mistake of leaving to retrieve the Devastator that they had lost in the world beyond two days ago... The Scout hadn't locked the house, and even if the house was locked, the Citizen had a lock pick on him at all times... Quickly glancing to the side, the Citizen began to push the old door open.</p><p>He wouldn't lie, he wasn't stealing from just every run of the mill hero.... This Scout had snuck past hordes, legions of zombies and came back to town unscathed after camping in the world beyond twice in a row.... Surely, if the town was made of heroes such as the Scout, things wouldn't have ended up as how they did..... A crazed Guardian, a hero by a random chance, was ignored by most and people where considering shunning the 'hero' for his questionable activities. His actions up to this point were trivial, but the Guardian was dragged into a depression like no other.</p><p>He thought everyone with in the town walls hated him, wanted to <em>eat</em> him.... He was wrong, and certifiably insane, but everyone let him be. Then, a groan sounded out from the other side of the town gates.</p><p><em>It beckoned him.</em></p><p>Walking towards the gates, the Guardian put his ear to the wall and heard the groan again... It was his friend, a Scavenger who had accidently swallowed a Cyanide pill when she was trying to eat a playing card from a deck of cards. Much to the Guardian's protest, they had tossed out her body to make sure that the risk of it becoming infected within the town walls was avoided.</p><p>Yet, the same voice had been calling towards the Guardian, makeing him believe that even in death, the two of them would be still be good friends.</p><p>He quickly opened the gates for the zombified Scavenger only to let out a shriek of terror as a horde of two hundred plus zombies started to flood in. The Guardian ha managed to survive by being pinned up into a corner with his shield, while the rest of the horde tore apart the rest of the town, leaving eleven others to quickly build the gallows and hang the Guardian. The Scout himself had proposed that he be the one to drag the idiot out of town, to which everyone let happen. They didn't want to do something so trivial and tireing...</p><br><p>Slowly, the numbers started to dwindle till only five were left and that was how the thief was in the position he was in now. Licking his lips, he began to walk into the Shack.</p><p>He had the wrought iron, all he need was some food to satisfy his hunger so he could have the strength to build up his home and possibly survive the attack.... The first thing the thief noticed when he stepped inside was that it seemed darker then outside had made the Shack seem... The second thing was the dead rotting corpse that swung down from the ceiling, a rusty chain keeping it from hitting the ground as it made the Citizen scream out in pure terror and hop backwards before turning around and running away to his shack and curl up into a ball on the mattress, the event terrorizing him and makeing his already fragile mind snap finally.</p><p>Letting out a dark chuckle, the Scout walked into his Shack and casually pushed the body of the Guardian out of his way. He sat down on his own Mattress and began to eat the tasty steak, the last man standing was a true hero......</p><p>Or just the Scout smart enough to trick the zombies into thinking he was already dead with a rotting corpse of an idiot.</p><p>Hey, it might stink up the shack... But the Scout reasoned that it was much better then the zombies eating him like a tasty steak.</p><p>Such was life......<br>. . .</p><p>Later that night, as the zombies began to wander the town and eat the other three citizens, the thief could hear the voices pick up in volume... starting to chant as he bit his nails in anticipation..... Then he heard it, the knocking on his shack and the anguished moan....</p><p>It...</p><p><em> It beckoned him.</em></p>

                <p>Here's the link if you want to see the Google Doc: it has all the right formatting and stuff. <br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1Ken-XEGJSzurtPUtk-4pmfhatCExt8GaP4E7xL-YHmk" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/document/pub?...</a></p><br><p>Mother<br>by alwaysmetara</p><p>My mother is a famous scientist. She is also the smartest person in the world. I know this because of what she said to me ten years ago.</p><p>I remember that day as clearly as if it was yesterday. I was only four years old at the time. My mother sat me down on the sofa and told me, "Rosemary, there's something I have to tell you..."</p><p>In my little-kid voice, I asked, "What, mother?" I looked up to her face with eyes full of trust.</p><p>My mother put her head in her arms and sighed. This was the first time that I noticed the lines in her face and the dark bags under her eyes. "I've done a lot of things I now regret, Rose. Because of them, you can never go to school and play with other children. All because of what I did to your brain when you were just a baby."</p><p>My mother looked utterly worn down and beaten as she continued: "I was too confident of myself after succeeding in the experiment which multiplied my brain capacity by four. I prided in myself being the smartest person in the world. I knew I can also make you smarter. So I did."</p><p>I remember myself looking at her with a mixture of confusion and awe.</p><p>"That's why you can never socialize normally with other kids; you're already smarter than most adults. If people find out what you are you'll be studied and prodded like a lab animal."</p><p>Then she went back to her laboratory to work.</p><p>*.*.*<br>Sometimes I wish that I was normal, as innocent as other kids, only caring about friends and grades and sports and other mundane things.</p><p>Instead, after my mother's health turned for the worse, I now have to take care of my mother. When she's not working feverishly in the lab, she's slumped across a random piece of furniture. Once, she almost set the house on fire from a botched experiment. She was standing in the middle of her lab, fire spreading quickly behind her, and she was laughing. Laughing. Her eyes were crazed, her hair was sticking out. She looked completely crazy. I quickly put out the fire and gave her a tranquilizer to make her sleep.</p><p>When I was seven years old, thieves invaded our house. They've somehow found out the location of the residence of the famous Dr. Langton and wanted the prize money that she had won. They had knives and guns and tried to force my mother to give them the money. My mother was babbling gibberish. The thieves shook their heads and started rooting through some documents I had carefully rewritten; my mother's papers to submit to prestigious magazines. What the thieves didn't know is that I hid the cache of money in the forest behind the house. With my mother slung on my back, I fled. I dug up the money and purchased a secluded cabin in the woods, where we now live.</p><p>At a time when my mother was lucid, she asked me why we were living somewhere different. I told her about the thieves, and she looked deep in thought. Then she retreated to the bedroom that was her new lab.</p><p>Later, when I walked in, she was labeling a small vial full of some strange, viscous liquid. In her small and neat handwriting, she wrote "The Solution to All Problems" and then handed me a few sheets of paper, covered in words: all her formulas and discoveries. It actually looked legible for once. I folded it up and stuck it in my pocket, vowing to look more closely at it later.</p><p>"This," my mother said, pointing to the small vial, "is the solution to all the world's problems."</p><p>She would say no more on the topic.</p><p>*.*.*<br>Sometimes my mother would turn crazy for a while. She would scream at me in gibberish while throwing things across the room. I could only try to protect the stuff in the lab, since our money was running out and we could not afford to replace the equipment. Other times, my mother would be depressed. Once I found her standing at the edge of the cliff, looking into the distance thoughtfully. Then she collapsed. I picked her up and carried her back home.</p><p>The worse is when she turns crazy while working in her lab. She would mix different toxic chemicals together, then pronounce it as the cure to cancer. I tried taking her lab things away once, but she made such a ruckus and a mess that I had no choice but to give them back to her.</p><p>After my mother was sound asleep, I would log onto her email account and reply to the other scientists and publishers that had sent her messages. I would submit papers that I wrote, using her name.</p><p>*.*.*<br>This is the way I lived for seven years. Sometimes I would fantasize about killing my mother. I could do it easily, I thought. With any of the toxic substances in the lab, I would poison her tea. After she slumps over in her chair for the last time, I would make it look like an accident.</p><p>I technically don't exist. My mother never registered me anywhere. Everyone else thinks she lives alone. So I could pretend to be from a neighboring village, hiking in the woods when discovering the house and the dead woman inside. I would call the authorities, then slip away. Then I can do whatever I please. I have many ideas of different compounds, when mixed together would create something new and useful for the world. I would become a famous scientist, a sane one.</p><p>However, my hand has always trembled right before poisoning my mother. I couldn't do it. Even though my mother has ruined my life, I couldn't do it. I felt too guilty. What was I doing, almost killing my mother? What monster had I become? Even after everything, morals kept me from being free.</p><p>*.*.*<br>I was cleaning out the lab, which was strewn with glass and strange liquids: the effect of another of my mother's fits. There was something in a dusty corner of the cabinet: a vial, forgotten and covered with cobwebs. I reached in and took it out. I had a distant memory of my mother saying, "This... is the solution to all the world's problems." I put it in my pocket. My mission was now clear. If it worked, my mother would be cured. If it didn't, then I would be free.</p><p>The next day, my mother was even crazier than usual. She stuck her hand into a vat of hydrochloric acid, then screamed as it burned her flesh. I ran into the room and performed the necessary first aid, thinking to myself, I must stop this before she kills herself and me with her.<br> <br>When she had calmed down, I gave her a cup of tea. But the tea was spiked with the liquid in the vial. I have decided that I could wait no longer.</p><p>After taking a sip, my mother found my eyes and said, "Rosemary, thank you for taking care of me. I'm sorry for acting so horribly."</p><p>It nearly broke my heart. Tears came to my eyes and I started to regret taking the risk which might cause my mother's death.</p><p>However, I could no longer stop it. My mother had drank all the tea already.</p><p>Suddenly, my mother stared at me with wide, clear eyes. Clear eyes that I haven't seen since I was four. Eyes not muddled by insanity.</p><p>I started to hope that the stuff in the vial worked, that it could actually cure my mother's disease. But then, my mother closed her eyes and was still. I walked over. She was still breathing.</p><p>My mother was in this state of coma for four days. It was the quietest and most peaceful four days I've had since forever, but I could not enjoy it. I was at my mother's side for all of the 144 hours, piling her with blankets, forcing water past her lips.</p><p>*.*.*<br>On the third day, I had a nightmare. I was standing somewhere high up. After a while I realized that it was the roof of our cabin. There was a crowd of people in the distance.</p><p>Then I heard the moans. They were like no sound I had ever heard before. The crowd of people lurched closer and closer. Their clothes were in rags; some of them were missing their limbs. I looked into their eyes. Their eyes were not human. Instead, they were filled with hunger.</p><p>Hunger for my flesh.</p><p>*.*.*<br>I woke up, screaming. I looked around. It was but a nightmare. I sighed in relief.</p><p>My mother was still in a coma. Would she ever wake up?</p><p>Then, on the fifth day, she stirred. I was overjoyed. My mother wasn't going to die! I discovered, then, even after everything she put me through, I still loved her.</p><p>I watched as my mother slowly stood up. But something wasn't right. Her eyes held no trace of recognition as she looked at my face. Then she moaned. It chilled me to the core.</p><p>I couldn't move. She stumbled closer and closer to where I was sitting.</p><p>I realized that the woman before me was no longer my mother. It was a monster, a monster I created by pouring the vial into the tea. The zombie apocalypse was going to come, and it would be all my fault.</p><p>I had turned my mother into a zombie.</p><p>Tears making my vision blurry, I grabbed the nearest object I could see: a chair. I tried throwing it at the creature that used to be my mother, but it just bounced off. Somewhere, distantly, I could hear a scream. Then I realized that it was my own.</p><p>Cornered, and out of options, I looked around the room. My mother was close to me, too close. I thought of my life. What have I achieved? Nothing! I am too young to die!</p><p>But none of that matters. My mother locked me into an embrace like she never did while she was alive. She put her head next to mine, almost like a kiss.</p><p>Then all was dark.</p>

                <p><em>This note was recovered next to several corpses, what remains of a town, and a blood-covered wrench.</em></p><p>Guess this is it, huh? I never figured it was gonna end like this. Saw too many of the corny movies, I guess. The survivors make it. Sure, a few people get hurt, but they make it.</p><p>Not this time.</p><p>Guess I should explain it, in the time I have left. Not sure why. Nobody is going to read this. Chances are, I'm the last uninfected human out there. And hell, that is only for about 10 minutes.</p><p>It all started a few months back. I was your average guy. Sat in an office, made spreadsheets. Never liked it. Man, how much I wish I could have that life back now. So, when that 'miracle' happened, my life went to shit. That doctor brought that girl back...it was just wrong. <em>Rest of paragraph illegible due to bloodstain.</em></p><p>Then, after it had all gone to shit, I drove, drove as far away from Atlanta as I could. My engine cut out. I was out of fuel. I ended up on foot. Things had gotten bad, what used to be called civilization is now a arid desert. Like, a world beyond our own. Ok, that's a good name. World Beyond. Why didn't I think of that before... Ah well, doesn't really matter.</p><p>So I come across this settlement. Settlement is the wrong word. More of a... group of slightly correlated beds. So, I found this bag of tools in my travels. Not much, but it came with this odd instruction manual. I used it along with some shitty sheets of iron and some rotten planks of wood some of the guys found to set up what remotely looks like a wall. At least it was gonna keep the zed out.</p><p>Next day things went a bit better. Found some blueprints to build a study. Some of the guy and me worked on it with the wood our scavengers found. We were disappointing at its lack of a practical purpose, but I found it very relaxing in there. Along with a nice room-temp vodka and a cheeky steroid (What were the odds I would live long enough to see side-effects?), I managed to think up this great idea and commit it to a blueprint.</p><p>This thing I designed was frankly, Brutal. I call it the zombie grater. What it does is pretty simple. Grates some zombies. We got that built, along with a watchtower to help us see the zeds coming and work out how much we need to prepare.</p><p>That day I noticed something. Not only did the Zombies have coordinated attacks, they also attacked exactly at midnight.</p><p>Something went badly the day after that. One of our scavengers had gone. We were hoping to find him, but we all knew. He was our fist loss.</p><p>Next few days were pretty uneventful. Scavengers were slowly disappearing. I would say we had about 20 or so left. I came up with increasingly disturbing traps, and me and the guys built them.</p><p>Day 7. That was the day it went to total shit.</p><p>We were working on building, and the newest trap wasn't quite operational. My trust watch had it's alarm go off. It was time. We knew some of them were going to get in. We hid in different places. Some went to their homes, others stood their ground. Me? Watchtower. If I had any luck the bastards wouldn't be able to climb.</p><p>The sun rose. The Zed had gotten their fill. We did a quick headcount. 11. 11 lives. Fairly quickly we armed the trap. Too late now, though. I never thought of anything new, however. I don't think anyone cared. We just all built our own homes up. 4 of use even set off out into the World Beyond to try and camp, or maybe find another settlement. I don't know why. Even if they did, it would end up like this. Surprised I lasted a week in this shithole, really.</p><p>My home was pretty poorly defended. On purpose. It was full of steak, and the corpses of my freshly dead friends. I couldn't really be respectful. Me, however, was in my old little cranny up in the watchtower. My watched played its' alarm. It was 5 minutes till midnight. I saw them, running toward the gate. Some of them died to the traps, but it was useless. Within seconds, they had broken through. hundreds, maybe thousands of rotting corpses after my brain.</p><p>The attack went by. I had survived. However, nobody else had. I was all that was left. The last man standing. Now, reading this, you probably imagined me lying in a pool of blood. Nope, I'm fine, for now anyway. 2 minutes till they attack. Sure, I might even survive another night or two. But they will rat me out eventually. I've done enough running. I've hidden behind these walls enough.</p><p>1 minute.</p><p>I can hear them, scurrying, ready to eat me. I got this gun set up. I call it a battery launcher. Clue's in the name. Oh god. My watch just beeped on the hour. I can hear them banging on the gates. I set up a makeshift barricade, as well as my little emplacement here. Sure, they're gonna get their fill. But they are gonna work for it.</p><p>Shit. The gate isn't holding. This may be the last thing I write. If you read this, know that I didn't fucking go down easy.</p><p>Ok. They started to break through my barricade. I had to retreat to my house. 'Bout 30 of them left. Surprised I did such a good job. But I'm all outta ammo. In fact, I may well be able to make it if I get really lucky.</p><p>Heh, what a joke. Lucky. I'm a dead man. I'm just in denial. This old bastard isn't done yet, though. I still got my trust old wrench. After all the work it's done keeping the rotters outta town indirectly, I think it should be able to do a fairly good job indirectly. Damnit. They're getting in. This IS the last thing I write. Me and my wrench versus that many zeds isn't ending well. Not at all.</p>

                <p>How is it possible that there are always new extensions of replenished desert waiting? How is it possible, when civilization is already gone? Or is new civilization forming and being destroyed as the horde advances through the desert? Or do we destroy it with every step of our own…</p><p>Ah, ignore the crazy questions of an old man, questions that cannot be answered, not to your satisfaction at least…</p><p>Now you may wonder, if you are paying attention, how can a man ever get to be old in this messed up world? As they send us all from our unknown origin, to these doomed towns in the blasted desert, where the corpses of those who came before us are intent on devouring us, and always succeed at the end, how can a man get to be old?</p><p>The answer to that is not short. If you wish to continue to live in peace, drop this piece of paper now. Bury it in the sand and carry on with your task, whatever that might be. I will not answer your questions, because the ones I will answer, you have never thought of… Instead I will place the seeds for more, burning questions that will tear your mind apart, as they have torn apart my own mind.</p><p>But I am old, and the secret, the secret has to be passed on, even if it is for the sake of nothing. So if you do not want to, do not read this, but leave this as you found it, to give another person the chance to make their own decision in the matter.</p><p>I shall start from the beginning, as this is complicated enough already to mess it up further.</p><p>Have you heard of the Leap? You probably have, if not by that name, then by another name, but you have surely heard of that event, where most of the living population froze for 2 days, unconscious and unable to be woken up, until the end of the second day. As may know, or imagine at least, this resulted on a feast for the undead population. In case you wonder, they call it the Leap, because those who woke up alive felt as if it hadn’t passed a single second.</p><p>You will see, I was in between that rather small part of the population that was awake. Some say we were lucky to be awake, while I would disagree. My town was young and strong, and all of those people died, but they died in peace, unaware. I, on the other hand, was very much conscious during the entire day. <br>Let me tell you what happened to me that day. For it changed my life.</p><p>The predictor had announced a record, or at least for us it was a record. An overflow of 500 zombies for that day. Since the day before, we had been working in our salvation, however. It was a reactor. It was going to protect us from all of them, along with the group of improvised defenses we were to prepare during the day.</p><p>However, I could not finish it alone. If just a couple more people had been awake... I tried injecting them coffee, twinoid, zombie blood, you name it and I tried it. It just wouldn’t work; it was as if their brains were unable to connect with their bodies.</p><p>With all of that work set towards the reactor, most of us were sleeping on the floor, easy meals for zombies. They were doomed, and so was I, if I stayed. With the reactor having consumed lots of our batteries, my trusty MKII only had one round left. And the zombies were all over the camping sites.</p><p>But some chance was better than no chance, so I bravely run towards them, trusting my MKII would save me, as it had many times before. And it did, but sooner than I expected. I didn’t even get to the camping site when I ran into ten zombies, all wanting a piece of me. Thanks to my MKII, I killed them all, but my last battery could not withstand the stress of blasting so many zombies, and it fell apart.</p><p>I felt desolated, although not exactly surprised. The surprise was that it lasted so long.</p><p>My last chance, as I saw it, was to head south, to the long ago cleared and depleted desert, and hope that the distance from town would be enough to save me when zombies came. A long shot, no doubt.</p><p>And so I did, and I did it well, so well that I got to the very edge of our maps No one had been here on a long time, but the zone was as devoid of all interest as it was recorded to be in the community’s maps. Or so I thought… The truth is that the zone had not changed, but there were still secrets in it. <br>It would take a little help, however, for me to see that.</p><p>You’ll see… As I got to that zone, I heard a loud croak, the one of a crow, but not content, as it usually is, but rather panicking, flying away from town and into the horizon. And, as it passed by me, and left towards the unknown extensions beyond the mapped area, it cleanly vanished from the sky, as if it had gone through an invisible wall that blocked my sight.</p><p>And as I walked towards that, hoping to see what it could have been, and hoping to get something useful from it, and found myself touching something that seemed like a glass. A tough one too, as I could not break it, not even scratch it, not with all my strength. And beyond it I could see the open desert, and I wondered what this glass was.</p><p>Maybe some sort of twisted experiment, maybe that’s what this was all along? Maybe we are someone’s toys? Who could be so cruel? Or what? It has something to do with crows, no doubt. But they are just birds, or aren’t they?</p><p>These questions were what I thought of for several hours. When <br>I realized it was dark already, and I had no hideout or a way to make one. As I started digging the tomb that would be my own if they found me there, as all tombs can be to those that hide within them, I realized.</p><p>Can I go under the glass?</p><p>It was a desperate idea, but the only one left. Even if I survived the zombies, curiosity was to kill me very soon. I had to know.</p><p>Now I know. Behind the glass there was nothingness, and as I dug through the last of sand, I was sucked into it. And as I slipped into this void I saw the zombies, those who were to attack my town, those you never see until they come, I saw them moving towards the world above, where my town awaited, unconscious.</p><p>Now I float in this emptiness, where all souls move through as they go to new life, to new death.</p><p>As the only mortal in this existence I live to see all. But do nothing, for here I am just a spirit with the misfortune to be trapped into my own body. They say that as my body dies, my spirit will do the “backwards cycle” and become an object in the real world. And that will stay there forever. Who are they?</p><p>The Crows. They control most of our lives. However they say they are only overseers, not gods, only ensuring that everything follows its path as it is desired by the ones above them. They never talk about the ones above them, at least not to me.</p><p>I have learned about many things of our world, most of them I will not tell you, for you must not know, for I should not know. There were others with my same fate. They told me about Devastator, the strongest warrior that ever lived. He was granted a wish after defeating a crow in a duel, and he wished to see the crow’s nest.</p><p>That rather badly thought wish brought him to the same place where I am now. He later turned into the weapon named after him, as the backwards cycle caught up with him.</p><p>Why? Because his nature dictated it that he should become a tool of great destructive power. Then what shall I become, what is my nature? I don’t know for sure. But if you are reading this note, you know.</p><p>I am person that thinks, that imagines, that formulates questions. And that is my legacy for you.</p><p>As a parting gift I leave you, aside from the many you already have, and the many more you will get as you think of this, with this one question, which I believe you might find most useful:</p><p>If you were to become an object, such as i, what would you become? Or in short, what is your true nature?</p><p>-<br>That's it. Think a bit about what you just read about... now.</p>

Hide from the tide which approaches, approaches from the west...<br><br>On the first night I came, I watched with tear strained eyes at the whole of the tide.

They talked and they talked but they do not listen, listen to the land, the land beyond.<br><br>The land where the tide waits, waits for the cage of light to dwindle and the doors of darkness to open.<br><br>Every day the walls grew and every night the tide broke on through, pulling more and more worms off into the darkness.

                <p>Why? Why was I stuck with the worst job and even that was taken away from me? At least I can watch these people suffer along with me for eternity. I’ll tell you about how it all started…</p><p>One day I was doing my job as normal and I’m suddenly being told that I’ve been laid off and replaced by some rookies. At first I thought it was a joke from one of my coworkers but then when I ask one of the higher ups they tell me that’s exactly what happened and nothing more. I tried to pry at them but they wouldn’t say a word. So now all I’ve got is watching other people do their jobs.</p><p>I decided I’d see how the rookies were doing on their first day. That’s when I noticed the world was in total chaos. Apparently the higher ups aren’t as all seeing as they say they are. Those rookies are still saying that everything is fine and the higher ups believe them! Have they seriously not noticed the zombies?! Well, since I was laid off, I can’t fix the problem and the rookies can’t fix it either because they don’t have enough experience.</p><p>Now all I have is watching the world and all the rookies do is punish the ones who get too out of line. They even decided to make themselves gods in the mortals’ eyes, calling themselves “Crows”. Bah! All they do is transport the souls of the people that died at the hands of the zombies and other circumstances that they let happen, into different bodies to build and die again. If only I had my job back I could fix this broken world and people would die properly again.</p><p><span class="tid_wspoil">In case you didn’t know that’s from the perspective of the newly jobless Grim Reaper.</span></p>

                <p><strong>Hunger. </strong></p><p>When we first gathered, people came from all walks of life. Rich, poor, educated and the illiterate. The apocalypse made us all equals. We decided that a total of 40 adults would be all we could support in this small community. All agreed that our common goal was survival. I guess when your very life depends on each other…there is a bond that is unshakable. We took over a small community at the edge of the vast desert.</p><p>There was an old pump that was working. It seemed pretty sluggish the last few days and there is concern that we may have tapped it out already.</p><p>There are a few buildings scattered around. But they don’t seem very safe so we built a wall of anything and everything we could find. We tore down the few remaining buildings and used the worn boards to build more fortification to keep out the zombies.</p><p>Our one radio stopped working days ago so we haven’t had any contact with the outside world. If there even is an outside world anymore. Our lives have narrowed down to our survival. How simple things are now. Food and water have never been more precious. I forgot what chocolate smelled like. Isn’t that funny? That it worried me more to miss the smell of chocolate? After all I have lost?</p><p>We have been fortunate so far… we hear the zombies at night. They push on the wall. They pull on the chains at the gate. Always testing to see if there is a weak area. In the first few days, when there were only a few zombies, we used precious water to kill them. That’s before we realized our water supply wasn’t endless. Now we fortify our walls as best we can. We all walk the perimeter. All of us take turns. We are safe during the day. The zombies only come at night. Every night their numbers increase.</p><p>We scavenge during the day. We all agreed we needed to do this daily. We try to buddy up and go in pairs. Especially when we find a new building. It’s amazing what people left behind when they ran during the dark days at the beginning of the apocalypse. Most of it is useless to us. But sometimes we find a few things that we treasure. Duct tape can fix almost anything.</p><p>I have been out all day. My pack is full. A copper pipe, a few cans of spam I found in a paper bag, a few other odds and ends. We are all rather weak from lack of food and water. We are rationing both. So we can only carry a few things at a time.</p><p>I am also bringing home something else this evening.</p><p>Last night…. 2 zombies got thru the gates. My tent was the nearest to the walls and from my guess, they only visited me. I wasn’t on watch. It was my night to sleep. They attacked me before I even awoke. I tried to scream for help. I suppose I was too busy fighting for my life to even have enough breath to scream. I kept a water gun under the bed. We are supposed to give everything to the community bank. But I am glad I kept it one more night. I was able to reach it and I killed both of the atrocities. I hid them in my tent. Covered with the blankets that had cushioned my cot for the last week. I didn’t even consider calling for help then.</p><p>The thing is…. one bit me. I can feel the poison coursing thru my veins from the wound in my arm. I went out in the desert today prepared to walk so far from town I would never be a danger to anyone. To the other 39 loyal citizens. I thought I would hide… maybe find a small cave so even if they looked, my friends wouldn’t find me. Just crawl in a cave and die.<br>But my mind won’t stop thinking.</p><p>Thinking about the 39 people in town. And I am so hungry. So very, very hungry.</p><p>Its only been a day. But the compulsion is almost overwhelming.</p><p>I don’t know how long my coherency will last, I know the way I am thinking is madness. I will walk through the gates this evening. I will go straight to my former tent. I will wait until dark. The human part of me, the last bit of humanity I have, screams in denial and horror.</p><p>But only in my head. I believe even that voice is quieter now that it is getting closer to twilight. <br>I am just so hungry. So very hungry.</p>

                <p>My friend pointed out a lot of errors. This is a repost with them corrected.</p><br><p><em>This note was recovered next to several corpses, what remains of a town, and a blood-covered wrench.</em></p><p>Guess this is it, huh? I never figured it was gonna end like this. Saw too many of the corny movies, I guess. The survivors make it. Sure, a few people get hurt, but they make it.</p><p>Not this time.</p><p>Guess I should explain it, in the time I have left. Not sure why. Nobody is going to read this. Chances are, I'm the last uninfected human out there. And hell, that'll only be for about 10 minutes anyways.</p><p>It all started a few months back. I was your average guy. Sat in an office, made spreadsheets. Never liked it. Man, how much I wish I could have that life back now. So, when that 'miracle' happened, my life went to shit. That doctor brought that girl back...it was just wrong. <em>Rest of paragraph illegible due to bloodstain.</em></p><p>Then, after it had all gone to shit, I drove, drove as far away from Atlanta as I could. My engine cut out. I was out of fuel. I ended up on foot. Things had gotten bad, what used to be called civilization is now a arid desert. Like, a world beyond our own. Ok, that's a good name. World Beyond. Why didn't I think of that before... Ah well, doesn't really matter.</p><p>So I come across this settlement. Settlement is the wrong word. More of a... group of slightly correlated beds. So, I found this bag of tools in my travels. Not much, but it came with this odd instruction manual. I used it along with some shitty sheets of iron and some rotten planks of wood some of the guys found to set up what remotely looks like a wall. At least it was gonna keep the zed out.</p><p>Next day things went a bit better. Found some blueprints to build a study. Some of the guys and me worked on it with the wood our scavengers found. We were disappointed at its lack of a practical purpose, but I found it very relaxing in there. Along with a nice room-temp vodka and a cheeky steroid (What were the odds I would live long enough to see side-effects?), I managed to think up this great idea and commit it to a blueprint.</p><p>This thing I designed was frankly, Brutal. I call it the zombie grater. What it does is pretty simple. Grates some zombies. We got that built, along with a watchtower to help us see the zeds coming and work out how much we need to prepare.</p><p>That day I noticed something. Not only did the Zombies have coordinated attacks, they also attacked exactly at midnight.</p><p>Things got bad the day after that. One of our scavengers was gone. We were hoping to find him, but I think we all knew. He was our first loss.</p><p>Next few days were pretty uneventful. Scavengers were slowly disappearing. I would say we had about 20 or so left. I came up with increasingly disturbing traps, and me and the guys built them.</p><p>Day 7. That was the day it all went to total shit.</p><p>We were working on building, and the newest trap wasn't quite operational. My trust watch had it's alarm go off. It was time. We knew some of them were going to get in. We hid in different places. Some went to their homes, others stood their ground. Me? Watchtower. If I had any luck the bastards wouldn't be able to climb.</p><p>The sun rose. The Zed had gotten their fill. We did a quick headcount. 11. Eleven lives. Fairly quickly we armed the trap. Too late now, though. I never thought of anything new, however. I don't think anyone cared. We just all built our own homes up. Four of us even set off out into the World Beyond to try and camp, or maybe find another settlement. I don't know why. Even if they did, it would end up like this. Surprised I lasted a week in this shithole, really.</p><p>My home was pretty poorly defended. On purpose. It was full of steak, and the corpses of my freshly dead friends. I couldn't really be respectful. Me, however, was in my old little cranny up in the watchtower. My watched played its' alarm. It was 5 minutes till midnight. I saw them, running toward the gate. Some of them died to the traps, but it was useless. Within seconds, they had broken through. hundreds, maybe thousands of rotting corpses after my brain.</p><p>The attack went by. I had survived. However, nobody else had. I was all that was left. The last man standing. Now, reading this, you probably imagined me lying in a pool of blood. Nope, I'm fine, for now anyway. 2 minutes till they attack. Sure, I might even survive another night or two. But they will rat me out eventually. I've done enough running. I've hidden behind these walls enough.</p><p>1 minute.</p><p>I can hear them, scurrying, ready to eat me. I got this gun set up. I call it a battery launcher. Clue's in the name. Oh god. My watch just beeped on the hour. I can hear them banging on the gates. I set up a makeshift barricade, as well as my little emplacement here. Sure, they're gonna get their fill. But they are gonna work for it.</p><p>Shit. The gate isn't holding. This may be the last thing I write. If you read this, know that I didn't fucking go down easy.</p><p>Ok. They started to break through my barricade. I had to retreat to my house. 'Bout 30 of them left. Surprised I did such a good job. But I'm all outta ammo. In fact, I may well be able to make it if I get really lucky.</p><p>Heh, what a joke. Lucky. I'm a dead man. I'm just in denial. This old bastard isn't done yet, though. I still got my trust old wrench. After all the work it's done keeping the rotters outta town indirectly, I think it should be able to do a fairly good job indirectly. Damnit. They're getting in. This IS the last thing I write. Me and my wrench versus that many zeds isn't ending well. Not at all.[/cite]</p>

                <p>I see. Thanks for letting me know. I'll clarify that over the weekend.</p><p>You're roughly right, but if possible, score them earlier. It goes like this:</p><p><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_arrow.gif" alt=":hordes_fleche:" class="tid_ico"> Round 1 submission until Oct 1 (entries no longer accepted on Oct 1). Round 2 starts.<br><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_arrow.gif" alt=":hordes_fleche:" class="tid_ico"> From Oct 1 to Oct 6 or 7, participants will be messaged with their scores and critiques. If unsatisfied, requests for rejudging (sort of like a recount) will be entertained in this time. Only requests made by Twinoid messages will be entertained, for obvious reasons.<br><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_arrow.gif" alt=":hordes_fleche:" class="tid_ico"> Oct 7 or 8, depending on when the last recount is done, round 1 winner announcements are made.<br><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_arrow.gif" alt=":hordes_fleche:" class="tid_ico"> Oct 15, Round 2 ends. Round 3 starts.</p><p>Which reminds me.</p><p>To anyone who wishes to be a judge for round 2, please Twinoid message me asap. A message like "I want to be a judge for round 2" is sufficient. I need a definite reply rather than a maybe. <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>As for the current guest judges, <span class="tid_user tid_user_472703 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="472703">Black-Cat</span> and <span class="tid_user tid_user_493888 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="493888">colette</span>, also Twinoid message me (again) if you want to keep on being a judge.</p><p>If there are more than 2 people who want to be a judge, we'll figure something out. But it's important judges are found before round 2 starts. <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Rotation of judges is there to give a chance to the current judges to participate if they want to, to let them step down if they can't judge, and to give others a chance to judge as well.</p><p>Also, judges always help decide the next round's theme.</p><p>Thanks for the enthusiasm everyone!</p>

The theme was suggested by <span class="tid_user tid_user_106554 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="106554">alwaysmetara</span> a few days ago <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">:</p><p><strong>Zephyr</strong><br>by <span class="tid_user tid_user_1764107 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1764107">Colette</span>.</p><p>(<em>Taken from the pages of an old notebook found at an underground building days ago. The notebook belonged to Dr. Eileen Goldstein.</em>)</p><p><em>“For that reason, the potential for its use under normal conditions is limited. Therefore, we have received instructions to suspend the project until further orders.<br><br> Roger E. Westmoreland<br> Chief R&amp;D Supervisor”<br><br>That’s what that simple-minded idiot wrote on his final report of the project. My precious project, which took so many years to be developed, now stomped flat by a group of dim-witted bureaucrats. It is no surprise that the potential for use is limited. Robert Oppenheimer and the other scientists involved in the Manhattan Project knew it very well. Even before Trinity, back in 1945, they knew their creation had a limited potential, yet they still carried on and eventually became successful, surpassing their own limits. In order to continue the progress, a testing process must be done in order to fine-tune the project. We cannot afford to rely only on computer simulations and dump it in the trash when a flaw is discovered. After so many years of continued effort… My effort.<br><br>I started the project thirteen years ago, back when I was a naïve girl, fresh from the college. Always looking for a way to save the world. How stupid of me. How is that even possible? Humans are stupid creatures. Don’t they deserve something better? Something far apart from their foolish ambitions of glory and power? That is what I strive for. And now those blockhead officers decided that I should stop my precious Zephyr Project. <br><br>——————————————————————————————————<br><br>Today Teri came to see me. She has been my sole ally through my constant struggles with the higher-ups. She is a fine person, albeit too naïve. I am sure she doesn’t really believe in the cause. She is the kind of people that think humanity can learn from their mistakes and avoid repeating them again. I wish she would just take a History book and read it, so she could see how wrong she is.<br><br>Anyway, it was thanks to her that I have not being ousted from the division, since she is the daughter of General Sherrington, who is in charge of the project. Being my childhood friend, Teri was always fond of me, and as we graduated together, she convinced her father to get me inside the project. That was so many years ago. Her father is not the brightest person in the world, but he has the power we needed. But Teri said that not even he was capable of preventing the project from being suspended. The orders supposedly came from above him. What a bunch of idiots.<br><br>In the meantime, our team has been attached to the Pharmaceutical Development division. We are working on a supposedly miraculous drug capable of providing an energy boost to a normal person without any adverse effects. A test on regular soldiers reported over a 130% increase in their overall physical resistance. The working name for this drug is Twinoid 500mg. They expect to release a commercial version of this drug when the testing processes are completed, but after witnessing the manufacturing processes, I would think twice before swallowing that little pill.<br><br>——————————————————————————————————<br><br>Three months have passed since the Zephyr Project was suspended, and we are on a stalemate. This is not what I got a Biochemistry degree for! I am doing those menial tasks with a group of empty-headed apes. They have separated our team into several other groups. Even Teri has been sent to another project. Now I am alone here, experimenting with antibiotics in test samples with this group of dim-witted gorillas. There’s a man in the group called Charles that can’t even learn my name, despite my identification tag says “Eileen Goldstein” clearly on it.<br><br>The truth is that Zephyr had its flaws, primarily its violent reaction with Hydrogen, which discomposes it. This primary flaw was eventually what stopped my project from being the success I wanted. If I only had the time to search for a way of eliminating the project’s Achilles’ heel, it would become something wondrous. A success that would make other achievements from humanity look smaller and irrelevant. But that dream vanishes in front of me. If only I could do what I originally planned…<br><br>——————————————————————————————————<br><br>Grief and sadness now fill the team of scientists I am leading. Charles Burton, one of our dear companions, died today of a heart attack today. He died in the dining hall this morning, while he was consuming his food. It is a horrible incident that will stain the perfect record of our team, especially now that our Paracetoid 7g has been a complete success and is waiting for approval for test in humans. The other projects I have personally been working on in the meantime have also been a success. Today I can declare that the project from the compound developed from the still unnamed Corrosive Liquid I discovered was a total success.<br><br>——————————————————————————————————<br><br>Finally! Project Zephyr was approved again after being suspended for such a long time. General Sherrington must have pulled the strings once more. A new team has been assembled, thankfully including Teri. I was assigned as the project’s leader again. Today we have arrived to our new testing facilities. We have been assigned to test Zephyr in an isolated part of the desert, which is a good way of saying we were sent to a place in the middle of nowhere. We are in an old Cold War-era nuclear shelter that has been modified for work with Level 4 biochemical agents. At least it has working air conditioning and the stupid snakes can’t enter and bite us here. The habitat is ideal for testing, as the lack of a dense ecosystem surrounding us and the isolation will probably let us safely test Zephyr at its full capability. We have been also been given a number of animals to test Zephyr on. At least we should be able to test the capabilities of Zephyr at its fullest.<br><br>——————————————————————————————————<br><br>We still cannot overcome the primary weakness of Zephyr. When the correct host is selected, the virus works amazingly. It can be transmitted by air and by direct contact, it is hard to detect and resistant to all forms of light and radiation. Once it infects a host, it will lie dormant until a change in the host awakens it. This change has to be dramatic, like severe trauma or death, in which Zephyr will take control of all but the basic instincts of the host, turning him or her into a mindless zombie, which will instinctively harm and eat other living beings for two purposes: to spread the infection and to replenish its energy to revitalize its cellular function. Nevertheless, Zephyr still has one flaw: Hydrogen destroys Zephyr. Although pure hydrogen is rare to see, pure water has enough hydrogen to cause the death of Zephyr and its host. In other words, even a simple rain can kill Zephyr and destroy its host. Some animal hosts, like pigs and rats, are capable of resisting the infection without developing the transformation at all. And if that was not enough, the beings capable of being infected by Zephyr lose most of their vital functions, including a deterioration of mind processes and motion capabilities. Also, direct sunlight is capable of reducing their metabolism to a state of torpor. Unless a potential victim approaches, the zombies will remain almost motionless through most of the day and move only on the darkness. <br><br>None of our experiments has been capable of reducing or eliminating these flaws. Nevertheless, the potential speed of spreading of the virus is impressive. That is the biggest advantage of Zephyr. By releasing the virus on a populated location, like a city, over 50% of the human population would be infected by Zephyr within 48 hours, and if no protection measures are taken, the 100% would be infected in less than a week. Many of the infected survivors would remain conscious and without any important symptoms for months, though the reanimated corpses would attack them, hastening the incubation period. <br><br>Our experiments still continue. I have the feeling that once these minor problems are over, we will have made a tremendous achievement for humanity.</em></p>

                <p>Part 2 [Because Twinoid thinks my story is too long <img src="../../../../gfx/square/hmm.png" alt=":-/" class="tid_ico">]</p><p><em>We finally made it! This experiment has accidentally given a huge step forward. I lost one of my scientists in the process, but who cares? They’re expendable, anyway. We just had to take good security measures to prevent accidental leaks of Zephyr and to avoid our own contamination.<br><br>Dr. Doug Johnson was in charge of the tests with Zephyr in rodents, and injected it onto a colony of rats. They only showed an increased growth and aggressiveness, but the virus did not change biological structure further. Rats can only be used as carriers. One of those giant rats bit Johnson, piercing his glove and puncturing his skin. Convinced that he was infected, he took his revolver and shot himself in the head. Instead of incinerating the corpse, I decided to lock him in the test chamber and watch the results. It was amazing. It was the first time Zephyr had been tested on humans. <br><br>The development of Zephyr in Johnson was not far from the results shown in the computer simulation. There is brain deterioration, decreased muscular capability, low reflexes, torpor state in hot and illuminated space and aggressive tendencies towards other living beings. Likewise, pure water is capable of damaging its body. The potential of using it as a biological weapon is extremely limited, but the virus itself could be capable of dealing a huge damage to a targeted city. If I could only convince the higher-ups to get me more test subjects. Prisoners, homeless people. I don’t care as long as I can use them as guinea pigs.<br><br><br>——————————————————————————————————<br><br>Teri could not stand the sight of Johnson transformed into a zombie, and decided to abandon the experiment. How could she betray me!? Now that the project is in an advanced state. Before leaving, she left me a letter asking me to abandon the project as well because of the risk. But I am not going to let it go just like that.<br><br>But that’s not my biggest concern at the moment. A group of test subjects has escaped from the laboratory. Some idiot left the doors open last night and a group of animals managed to get outside of the facility through the ventilation system. But they won’t last long out in the desert without food and water. I just need to silence my teammates and keep them from releasing the information to the officers in charge, or else my project will be in danger.<br><br>——————————————————————————————————<br><br>This isn’t good. Not good at all. One after another, my team of scientists has shown effects similar to those of the infection. I am afraid there was a leakage of the virus, probably related to the accidental release of test subjects a few days ago. I had no choice but to gather my scientists and shot them all, and lock them out in the experiments room. But they are strong in numbers, and they managed to break the bulletproof glass and escape. Now I am afraid I might be infected as well. I will attempt to escape from this laboratory, but it is going to be difficult. Those stupid zombies are blocking my escape routes. My revolver is empty, and I can’t find more bullets anywhere… I might become one of them, and then… Zephyr will go out of control. But that is fine. Zephyr is my creation… Zephyr will punish mankind. Go out there, my dear Zephyr, and destroy that hateful humanity! There is only one concern in my mind right now. If I die, my soul… Will it continue to live on forever?<br></em></p>

                <p><em>The sand was cool.</em></p><p>I stared at the one whom I thought of as a brother. Shivering against the sand, we stared at each other, too scared to stare elsewhere.</p><p>He grinned.</p><p>The grin almost said, “It’s okay, everything will be alright pal, just wait and see!”</p><p><em>But how could I know?</em></p><p>I clench my eyes shut as tears almost break through. As prisoners try so hard to escape from their caged lives, these tears wanted to break free.<br> I would not let them.<br> I had to be strong.</p><br><p>We had said we could do it all, everything. We wouldn’t need anything, that we could make it on our own.<br>But it seems plan don’t always go as they seem…</p><br><p><strong>A small hum picks up in my ear on the ground.</strong></p><br><p>Hearing this, I clench my overall straps, as my comrade grins away in his old orange shirt.<br>His grin hasn’t changed.</p><p>I try to speak, but I cannot. My chest is welled up with fear; all I can do is stare.</p><br><p><strong>The hum in the ground becomes almost a faint vibration.</strong></p><p>I clench my eyes tight once again, and hope to fall asleep. Yet, no comfort comes my direction.</p><p>Instead, something <em>else</em> is.</p><p>It doesn’t matter how or why we got here. But here and now, I am drenched in fear. I am scared.</p><p>Scared <em>for</em> life.</p><p><em>My</em> life.</p><p>My <em>friend’s</em> life.</p><br><p>I look up now, to receive the grin of my friend, needing comfort more than ever. As my shaking head follows the glance of my eyes, there is no sly contenting grin awaiting me.<br>Instead, a pale face. It looks into the distance, in the direction my back is facing. <br>Against my will, I peer over my shoulder.</p><p>As if ants moving over a sugary substance on the ground on a hot summer’s day, feral packs of pure evil moves this way. Running is no option. <br>We shall wait.</p><br><p>I wince as my friend grasps my wrist, and does not let go. He is shaking.</p><p>As am I.</p><br><br><p>I clench my eyes tightly, and through the fear I experience, or my overall exhaustion, I almost black out. <br>Peace. <br>Quiet.</p><p>I finally feel happy. <br>My brother by my side, I feel invincible again.<br>We can face any danger, we are a team!</p><p>I realize a slight discomfort, in this peaceful state of mind.<br> <br>Feeling a harsh tugging on my entire body, I open my eyes.</p><p>Around me, feet stomp and stampede.</p><p>Degenerating and decomposing fleshy bodies fly down onto my <br>comrade and I, separating us.<br>Before everything goes silent, I hear screams from him and myself.</p><p>He still has a grip on my wrist, as I have a grip on his. <br>We are being ripped apart by the undead hordes.</p><p>I look into his face. Now tears drip from his eyes, as I let mine out too.</p><p><em>The prisoners have escaped.</em></p><p>The power becomes too much, and in a now silent world, a slight ringing begins as I feel a release in my arm, and I am dragged away from my friend. <br>My comrade. <br>My brother.<br>My <em>best</em> friend.</p><p>Through the legs of the deteriorating monsters, I see him.<br>He sees me.</p><p>We stare at each other, grin-less.<br>Wearing a brave look, he is dragged under a pile of bodies, and as my silent world becomes a blur, I now know I will suffer the same fate.</p><p>I catch a glimpse of the sky, and as I do, a black bird flies over the hazed yellow moon.</p><p>I begin being dragged around as if I were a rag doll.<br>I feel a splash of warmth over my face and body. Great purges of strain and stress my body, and then large releases. <br>My world is silent, and blurred. All I see are the slow moving bodies crawling on top of me.</p><p>All I hear is a slight ring, and the pound of my heart.</p><p><em>I am alone. </em></p><p>My vision fades out, and the ringing becomes softer. The little vision I have left becomes a dark, Carson red. And then so dark that I make out no figures at all.</p><br><br><br><br><p><em>Silence</em></p><br><br><br><p>A sensation of needles pricking my entire body takes over. <br>The pricks slowly form to a cold, wet sensation all over.</p><p>I begin to jolt. It feels as if I am touching an old, rusty, electric fence over and over, until I feel a tingling radiating around me.</p><p>The warm sense hits me in small grains over my body. <br>I make a small movement, and as I do, a white blinding light enters my vision.</p><p><em>I am opening my eyes.</em></p><p>The light continues to burn my eyes to a point where the color seems dark, as it is light.<br>A shadow appears before me. I squint my eyes. <br>The shadow blocking the light presents itself as a figure.<br>I make out a humanoid. A human.</p><p>Gaining body movement, I numbly sit up. I close and open my eyes, until I am partially adjusted to my surroundings.</p><p>Questions flutter through my mind.</p><p>Through mass confusion, I hear an odd sloshy sound, and I realize the man is speaking. <br>At that instance, the words are as clear as the light itself.</p><br><p>“Sir?” The voice asks, “Sir, are you alright?”</p><br><p>I look up, and make out a male’s face and body structure through a silhouette. Though, facial features are not yet recognizable.</p><p>I begin to recollect my memories, but find I have none.<br>How did I get here?<br>Who am I?</p><p>Holding my face, I become aware of a pounding headache. I find that my cheeks are wet, as well as directly under my eyes… Tears?</p><p><em>Not important.</em></p><p>I feel as if there is something to remember. Someone. But I cannot recall.</p><p>The man repeats “Sir?”</p><p>I look up at him, and stumble to my feet.<br>Face to face, I see a man about my height, wearing an odd orange shirt. He grins a sincere and friendly grin at me, as I stare back.</p><p>Despite being in mass confusion, I know one thing.<br>It is clear to me that I have never met this man before.</p><p>“Sir?” he asks again.</p><p>“Whe-” I try to speak. “Where am I?”</p><p>“Follow me,” he says, “It’s okay, and everything will be alright pal, just wait and see!”</p>

My computer has crashed and all. I just got it replaced.</p><p>Currently, the judges are scoring the 10 entries so far. Remember that entries will be accepted until the last day of September, so if someone out there wants to submit an entry, they've got until the end of the month to submit. Once the clock/calendar strikes October, Round 2 will begin.</p><p>The theme for round 2 is currently being deliberated and the guest judges for that round are being selected. The theme and judges will be announced in October as well.</p><p>A couple of days before Round 2 begins, expect that us judges <span class="tid_user tid_user_493888 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="493888">colette</span> and <span class="tid_user tid_user_472703 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="472703">Black-Cat</span> will have exchanged our scores and prepared our write-ups. Then we will be Twinoid messaging the participants with their total scores and write-ups asap. Each participant gets one write-up from one judge.</p><p>In the meantime, again, the round is not yet closed and new entries may still be submitted. You are all free to use this thread to discuss the entries, suggest themes, or do other forms of contribution to Write2Nite. <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Thanks again, everyone, for the excellent first round. Really, I wasn't expecting it to be this great.

                <p>Question to all round1 participants.</p><p>We will be showing you only one number, which is your total score (judge1 score + judge2 score + judge3 score = total score). But you can ask for a breakdown of the scores if you're not satisfied with just that, and you'll get to see what each judge gave you individually.</p><p>I won't be allowing the judges to give their personal breakdowns (how much did they score on clarity? on coherence? on the bonus? -- not allowed). This is because I'd rather not have the judges explaining themselves. It's not their job and we have to respect the judges' opinion. Plus you will each be getting your own critiques from one judge, anyway.<br><br>So here's the question. Would you rather see the breakdown per judge straight up (you want to see judge1 score, judge 2 score, and judge3 score, separately), or would you rather see just the total score?</p>

You may tell me the title by Twinoid message or by posting here. This is so your work will not simply be called “Entry #” on the external site archive (<a target="_blank" href="http://w2n.deuame.com/archive">here</a>).</p><p><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_arrow.gif" alt=":hordes_fleche:" class="tid_ico"> The W2N Archive will be updated completely after every announcement. It will contain the entry, the writer’s username, the total score, and the critique. As such information will be kept private before the announcement, we’ll have to wait until after the announcement for updating.</p><p><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_arrow.gif" alt=":hordes_fleche:" class="tid_ico"> Applications as judge for round 3 are now open. Please Twinoid message me ASAP if you want to take a seat as a guest judge for round 3.</p><p><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_arrow.gif" alt=":hordes_fleche:" class="tid_ico"> Please review the <a target="_blank" href="http://w2n.deuame.com/rules">Rules</a> if you are new to the contest. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to Twinoid message a judge, or post here.</p><br><p><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Themes!</span></span></p><p>Alright!</p><p>For this round, there will be <strong>two</strong> themes. Participants may choose to do either one of these themes. You are free to not follow them if you don't like them. However, remember that not following the theme will incur a penalty of 150 points per judge, so be sure to stick to them as much as possible.</p><p><strong>The themes are:</strong></p><p><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_arrow.gif" alt=":hordes_fleche:" class="tid_ico"> Punishment – Present a story that involves someone getting hanged, about to get hanged, or just got hanged from the gallows. The important thing is that somebody must get hanged from the gallows, <em>and</em> the story must revolve around punishment.</p><p><em>Crimes are always punished, but people always are too lenient. Or too cruel? Either way, that person at the gallows seems to have a different opinion about it.</em></p><p><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_arrow.gif" alt=":hordes_fleche:" class="tid_ico"> Apocalypse Happens To Your Town – Imagine a scenario where you, the contestant, are suddenly trapped in a zombie apocalypse in your hometown. Tailor it specifically to your actual, real life hometown. What happens to your neighbors? Your school? Your parents? Your job? You?</p><p><em>Everyone's a zombie now. There's nobody left.<br><br>I'm holed up in this convenience store stuffing the last of the M&amp;M's and Dr. Pepper that I can into my bag. But as I do, I can't help but think... I'm loaded, I'm alive, I'm alone. What do I do now?</em></p><p>The themes were created by <span class="tid_user tid_user_493888 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="493888">colette</span> and <span class="tid_user tid_user_675871 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="675871">joanne</span>.</p><br><p><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Something Extra!</span></span></p><p>There is also an extra element to be added this round. This is the judge’s incentives, taken from the judge’s bonus. Each judge is free to present their own mini-tasks, like mini-themes (but they don’t have to provide you with this). As the participant, you are free to choose if you want to do these mini-themes or not. Each one has an accompanying reward, which will be taken out of the judge’s bonus portion of the criteria. The most points you can get this way is +50 per judge.</p><p>Keep in mind that the judge’s bonus is 200 points max per judge, and whether or not you do these tasks, you will still be eligible for receiving 200 points max from each. But in doing them, you are guaranteeing yourself of getting a certain amount of bonus points – and believe me when I say that bonus points are very much a deal maker or breaker.</p><p><strong>Here are my mini-themes:</strong></p><p><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_arrow.gif" alt=":hordes_fleche:" class="tid_ico"> Include a Hunger Games (YA novel by Suzanne Collins) reference anywhere in your entry. + 5 points. But if I like it, + 25 more points (for a total of +30 points).</p><p><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_arrow.gif" alt=":hordes_fleche:" class="tid_ico"> Include the gun model Colt 1911 MK IV Series 80 in any way, shape, or form. Exact model, and must get an exact mention. Simply Colt 1911 MK IV does not qualify. + 10 points.</p><p><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_arrow.gif" alt=":hordes_fleche:" class="tid_ico"> Include any kind of hunting rifle. + 10 points.</p><p>Stand by for <span class="tid_user tid_user_675871 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="675871">joanne</span> ‘s and <span class="tid_user tid_user_106554 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="106554">alwaysmetara</span> ‘s bonus tasks. <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Some Final Words</span></span></p><p>I would like to thank you all for participating in Write2Nite’s first round from the bottom of my heart. Thank you all for making it such a brilliant success! All those entries were gold. But in the end, there can only be one winner per round. It was definitely an exciting process for all of us <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>That said, let Round 2 officially begin!</strong></p>

                <p><em>How stupid and weak one can be. How terribly numb you can become when at the foot of deaths door. When one is stricken by the pain that can be avoided... <br><br>The blood dribbled down from my thankful mouth. In behind the broken white cage the small creature at the back of my mouth danced in a lustful joy, it wriggled in pleasure at the great taste of <strong>meat</strong>. The white steak that lay at my lap stopped its useless struggle and stiffened up. My eyes grew red with lust. My body throbbed with pleasure, which was sure to be short lived because this horrific <strong>sin</strong> would not go unnoticed. The rats and the cats were not missed, but the little white meat, once gone by the name of Blondie, was too relevant to the town to disappear. It's master would soon return, and it would only be a matter of time before the smudge in <strong>their</strong> society would be wiped clean through death. With maddened courage I interrupted the creatures joyous dance and removed the white meat from it's broken cage. I stood, with the blood of my sin still dripping from my monstrous mouth, and left my tattered tent. Their eyes stabbed into my soul. They all watched as I left, as I ran, a coward I live, a coward I die. For it is only a matter of time before the master is informed of her loss, and the dreadful hammers beat down in completion of my gallery. I will be exposed as the weak worm, which I know I am. And with regret far from mind, I ran.<br><br>Out in the night, I can see the <strong>fright</strong>, the eternal mass. It comes from the south, I flee to the north.<br><br>Out beyond the beyond I wait. The great wall of fear that contains the petty bastion of sanity. We are trapped in a pit with the flood of death rolling down into our doors. But <strong>beyond the wall</strong>, what lies there? I stand staring and wondering. It is clear that us ourselves are trapped here by nothing more than fear. A sudden <strong>jolt</strong> ran up my spine, I knew then that it was almost my time. The rope was tied, the structure complete. With a burst of rage, I sprinted forward, head-first, into the sludge of fear. <br><br>My body shook, and my mind bashed. My whole essence vibrated violently, I closed my burning eyes and ran farther and farther, deeper and deeper, hoping to shirk death himself by entering where even he feared. And suddenly I was afloat, no, <strong>falling</strong>. With a crumpled thud, my body ceased its self-inflicted assault. With great effort I returned to my feet. All around me lay darkness, until I realized with annoyance that my eyes were closed. I opened them to be met with a green light. It illuminated the small room, and revealed what seemed to be a mess of wires and machines. I cautiously <strong>tip-toed</strong> around, spying cases of "whirring" and wonder. Up against the wall propped a case with the label "Colt 1911 MK IV Series 80", and under read "R.I.P Gale, A Bright Young Boy Full Of Twisted Traps And Twisted Morales". I tried to open the case in curiosity, but to my disappointment It was locked. A shrill beep startled me, and I turned to meet a large monitor, the source of the green light. Across the screen spread much jiberish, a lot of [ERROR] and [DATA CORRUPT]. My eyes moved moved to the newest command, and in <strong>horror</strong> I read /Player SaucyemmettC EXPUNGED. My eyes desperately searched for a button to press, to escape. With a victorious cry I noticed a round red button at the bottom of the monitor. It wore a heavenly title, "End Process". My hand <strong>shot</strong> out but before my fingers could feel the key to my final release I felt the hard pull of metal chain links pull me from the green lights, and pull me off into...</em></p><p><span class="tid_wspoil"><em>The End</em></span></p>

                <p>Gather around children, story time for the ye old broadcaster, this story is called, the last of us</p><p><em>as the infected have finally stopped with the banging of the gates and the screams have lowered to dead silence, survivors finally left their homes to see what happened, it seems a lot happened, as almost every citizen in town has been eaten and mauled in tonight's raid, their will only so much of us left, in fact their was four of us left, all of us losing hope at a very rapid rate, then one survivor went to the radio station and sent out a broadcast to the remaining three survivors saying, listen i know thing's look bad, but if we work together we can survive another night don't lose hope yet, because i haven't, the other three survivors agreed on staying alive, so they did what they could for the day, sinking all their strength into traps and temporary buildings for the undead, their wasn't enough survivors to find out how many were gonna attack so, the survivors hoped that it was turn out well in the end, <br><br>the next day, the gates and defenses held on the gates and the walls, when zombies got in the survivors violently beat them with logs and rocks, as the infected left to feast another night, the survivors realized that, they must evacuate the town, so every one started getting supplies and resources and decided to head out, their were only four of them left, they had one goal, to make it to the bunker, it was a long trip but they had to make it, we kept moving and pressing on, each of them had to carry a specific type of items, one carried water, one carried important supplies, one carried food and drugs, and the broadcaster carried weapons, when we got to the bunker it was swarmed with infected by infected, so the broadcaster bravely threw a explosive water bomb at the infected horde, bringing them down to one zombie, and then the broadcaster realized that last zombie was his friend during the zombie raid two day's ago, he couldn't bare to kill his friend, he gave one of the survivors a burnt out torch to kill the infected, after a few minutes of savage beating, the survivors made it into the bunker, the bunker's air was thin and the stench of dead took up most of the bunker's air, so the survivors agreed to keeping the bunker door's open till midnight, if they went with that plan one would have to be a guard, the broadcaster agreed to being the guard of the bunker<br><br>the attack was near, the survivors were ready, with the supplies they found in the bunker they were ready to repel the zombie attack if they get in, the closed the gate, and got ready, they started hearing loud clanging noises in the vents, as one survivor shouted, THEY'RE COMING IN FROM THE VENTS, so the survivors stood their ground, then the infected started coming in from different rooms of the bunker, the survivors fought bravely, the front gate was not destroyed, but one survivor was bit, and it was the broadcaster, after the attack he look at his wound with a dead look on his face, after several minutes of silence, the broadcaster stood up, put his belongings on the ground, and decided to leave, but not without making an impact, he started to strap makeshift explosives to his body, he said he was gonna clear a path to town so you will all have a chance to get supplies if needed, he walked out into the desert without another word, an hour later, an explosion was heard near the ruined town, the survivors knew he did what he had to do before he changed into one of them, <br><br>midnight, round two, it was time for the survivors to make their last stand, because they knew, the damage done on the bunker door was too great for them to survive another night, they got ready with a look of determination on their faces, ready to fight, as they expected, the bunker door broke down within minutes, they fought to the very end, at the end of it all, one survivor was left standing, he gazed at the corpses of his two comrades, and said to himself in a faint voice, i am alone, he buried the corpses of his friends in the front, and decided to end it all with a cyanide pill he found in the bunker, he took a tall glass of water, and repaired the front door as best he could, he repaired it with scrap metal, mud and wood, and even the bones of the undead, he spray painted something near the entrance saying, this place is safe, if you are looking for a safe haven, this is your place, enter the code 5503 to get in, he sat in his room, looking at his pill for several minutes, after saying to himself, no, i won't do this, their are survivors who will need help, but, what more do i have to live for in this world, he sat in his room for several hours thinking, just thinking and thinking what to do, until, he just decided to end it all, he decided to leave the bunker so his corpse wouldn't stink up the place, he stood near the entrance, closed the gate behind him, and sat down, holding a glass of water in one hand, and a cyanide pill in the other, he gazed into the wasteland, the last thing he hears is the sound of the wind, and the last thing he sees is his sign to the other survivors, he took his pill, drank the whole cup of water, and death came very quickly, as the last thing he actually saw was several shadowy figures in the distance, he thought they were survivors and he made a mistake, but at the same time, he thought they were infected, he didn't know what to think, other then it's finally over, he gave one last breath, and died,<br><br>this is the story of the last four survivors of a doomed town, this was their story</em></p>

                <p>Here we are, after some ultra complex brain tuning up(also known of hitting one's head repeatedly with a wrench).</p><p><em>Let me tell you a story, son.<br><br>The story of how I came to run into you and that cute dog of yours, Blondie, when you were both babies, and I was dumb enough to take you with me, in what was surely the BEST decision in my life.<br><br>You will see… It all started with my father, your grandpa. He had found me wondering around the desert, and I was only as old as you are now. So he took me to his town with him. It was called Twisted Void.<br><br>In those days the town was pretty much empty. Only 10 people lived in it. But then, they stated to arrive. They called themselves The Coalition. 30 of them ended up arriving to the town, and then it was filled up.<br><br>Your grandpa told me, as he saw them settling in, “I have a bad feeling on this one bunch of fellows…” He was, eventually, proven to be right. However, the zombies we had all fled away from were coming and defenses had to be prepared, so to start a fight with the guys from The Coalition wouldn’t have been bright.<br><br>The first days it was easy. They were organized as a sort of military, and the results were good. They explored the area, improved the walls, established systems for organized scavenging, water and food rationing, and coordinated building efforts. As days passed on, we started to notice that things weren’t all good.<br><br>While we were kept on strict rationing and almost starving, they were eating plenty of tasty food, they had free access to medicine while we struggled to get some. As they had taken control over all weapons and supplies, we couldn’t even go outside without permission. <br><br>Some people protested. Gallows were built, sturdy and tall. They did not hesitate to use them. And so there were only 38 in the town. After that, things only got worse. We were all split up in between their work groups, and there were regular patrols to make sure we hadn’t hidden anything away.<br><br>We heard speech from their leader. He talked about fighting some underground organization, but it was pretty obvious that it was just an excuse for their restrictive measures. By that time, 10 days of zombie attacks successfully repelled had passed, and yet only 35 of us remained.<br><br>Your grandpa was nervous about this, and he called me to talk in private. He showed me a pistol and told me “Son, this is a Colt 1911 MK IV Series 80. And, believe it or not, it is loaded.” <br><br>As you well know, to find a loaded gun of any kind in the desert is nearly impossible. He told me the story of this gun, how it was an inheritance of his family from long ago, and how his ancestors had been so careful with both the gun and its ammo.<br><br>As he was showing me how to give it proper maintenance, we heard a noise on the door. Then it opened, and one of the captains from the coalition, a big man with a riot shield, entered the house. “What do we got here? You know well that hoarding is not allowed.” He said, as he saw the gun. “It is just some harmless decoration” my father answered. “Well, I am taking it back!” said the captain, and he grabbed it. My father wouldn’t let go of it, and they started fighting. <br><br>In the middle of the confusion I grabbed it and it went off. The Captain was dead, with his head torn apart. Then my father started kicking his head. As I asked him what he was doing, he told me to get the gun and run back home. <br><br>They wouldn’t know what had happened, and he could take the fault. He told me that I should rob the bank and run away first thing tomorrow morning. I heard the people of The Coalition coming towards the house, so I left through a window in the back.<br><br>He was hanged later that day. Luckily, they didn’t suspect I was involved. The next morning, before dawn, I sneaked into the bank and got away with 2 water rations and a piece of the tastiest steak.<br><br>From there I walked towards a forest where I had planned to spend my first night. By the time I got there it was night already. I found a nice spot right on top of a big old tree, crawled in and went to sleep.<br><br>That morning I continued travelling. I didn’t know if The Coalition was after me, but I wanted to be sure there was a good distance between me and the town before finding a more permanent hideout.<br><br>I eventually got to a clearing in the forest, with a big rock in the middle. There I found a camp bed, and a fire that was still lit. I decided to hide nearby, and see if anyone returned to that camp.<br><br>Eventually, someone showed up. It was a man on a brown cloak, and he was carrying two baskets. Inside one of them there was a baby that was crying. He also had a hunting rifle on his back. He seemed to disregard the child entirely, and I was rather concerned. When he grabbed a knife and got the baby out of the basket, it was very clear what he was going to do.<br><br>I ran towards him with my gun and told him to stop. “Hey, first of all, this is none of your business. Second, unlike your gun, mine is loaded”, he said, and he pointed at me with his rifle.<br><br>We both stood still, waiting for the other one to back down. He started charging at me, and I shot him in the chest. As I went over to check him up, I heard him say “it really was loaded… who would have known?” Then he died.<br><br>Then I checked the baskets. One was you, son, and the other one was Blondie. He didn’t have any supplies whatsoever, and I was going to have a hard time getting by myself, but I decided to carry the two of you with me. Luckily enough for the three of us, there was a town not too far away. And a very well made one, considering we are still here after so many years. <br><br>The Crow looks after animals, kids and idiots, they say.</em></p>

                <p>OKAY! so Joanne told me to enter this, I've just been adding onto it daily as I survive in my town. now, I do not have a title as of now but I'm working on it. so here goes</p><br><p>Its been 3 years since patient zero was injected with an experimental vaccine for cancer and acquired a hunger for human flesh. Aleks walked down the deserted streets of his "town" dirty and spattered in blood, he rummages through small areas looking for supplies, this town long been cleaned of all zeds, supplies were scarce as he looked through a department store, nothing but a few lumps of steel. He drank from his canteen as he walked home with not much to show. He steps into his well fortified house and checks on his girlfriend Emma, she has been sick for months and shows no sign of getting better, he goes to fill his canteen and bring her water, half full the spout sputters and water shuts off, gulping in horror as he realizes his well has dried up, a creek behind him and he flips around, Emma stands there, her hair covering her face as she drools.</p><p>"s...sweetie? are you okay?" says Aleks</p><p>a groan suggests no as she stumbles forward, teeth bared, Aleks acts quickly, sidestepping and DDTing Emma, a loud crack as her cranium busts on the marble floor, sniffling, Aleks dumps the last of his water on her, her flesh melts to a stinking puddle with bones, Aleks cries sadly as the last of people he cared about is now gone. He does so for hours till he can cry no more, he stands and grabs his rucksack, packing it with his last food ration, and some small supplies, readying himsef to leave at dawn.</p><br><p>end day 1</p><p>Aleks woke at the crack of dawn, immediatly grabbing his rucksack and heading out towards the closest neighboring town, 20 miles away, the sun beats on his back as he walks, hours pass and near 2 hours into his trek he hears the faint roar of an engine. In the distance he spots it, a small black square with a dustcloud behind it, overjoyed at the thought of humans Aleks runs towards it, waving his arms and hollering as loud as his dehydrated throat could muster.</p><br><p>The big black hummer stops in front of him, a burly man steps out.<br>"Oi! you bit?" he calls, aleks shakes his head and a slender girl steps out wielding an automatic rifle, she silently comes over and inspects him for bites, none. She leadss him to the truck silently and sits him inside next to a kid, a boy around 12, tied up. the truck rolls out towards the town.</p><p>"Water?" Aleks croaks out, a canteen is passed and he quickly empties it, the burly man laughs</p><p>"where'd you come from kid?" he asks</p><p>"the town back there, there isnt much left there, no reason to go..." replies aleks, the girl sits silently in the passenger seat, Aleks pulls out a cigarette and lights it, inhaling deeply. "I'm Aleks...thanks for saving me, I dont think Ida made it much further without water."</p><p>"Rex." the man says, the girl looks back at Aleks "Lady Shade." she says in an untrusting tone. "watch the kid. he likes to attack people...I had to kill his parents and he didnt like it." she says</p><p>the ride is long and silent as they head wherever they were going, Aleks falls asleep. Waking up from a screeching of tires, the truck turns to a skid and rolls, shaking his head a barely audible voice is heard "Are you okay?" It was the girl, a horrid look on her face, Aleks nods and pulls himself from the wreckage. Rex lays dead, half under the trucks, blood drips from his mouth, Aleks rummages over the body "what the hell happened?" he asks</p><p>"he fell asleep" says the girl tearing up, Rex was obviously her lover or a family member. Aleks takes Rex's boots and straps them on, much more comfortable than his sneakers that were torn and shredded, he looks at the boy, a bleeding scratch on his head, he is knocked out. Lady Shade leads Aleks to a cave nearby.</p><p>"we'll camp here..." she says distantly, Aleks goes into the cave to inspect it, nothing, he uses rocks and branches to make a wall closing off the cave, starting a small fire, Shade ties the boy to a post, he spits in her eye and she slaps him leaving a handprint</p><p>"you need to be nicer boy. She did what she had to to keep you and her alive." says aleks, Shade sits facing away from the fire and mourns Rex's death. Aleks pats her back "I didnt know much of him, but any man that would stop to pick someone up nowadays is a great one." Shade swats him away</p><p>"shut up" she says. Aleks steps away and sits by the fire, setting up a slab of rock on top, he opens his last ration "pork n' beans" he says, setting the can to heat up on the rock, after a while it boils and he tips it into a small bowl, eating some and passing it to Shade, she picks at it a little and Aleks lays down to sleep.</p><br><p>End Day 2</p><p>Aleks wakes at the sound of moaning, the fire has died down but its still slightly visible, he hears it again and pokes the fire a few times, it wakes and he gets a better view, some stray zeds are right outside the makeshift door. He opens the door and expertly roundhouses the head off a zombie, the body drops and he kicks the other in the stomach, power bombing him and shattering his neck. Lady Shade comes over rubbing her eyes.</p><p>"whats that noise?" she asks, not fully awake</p><p>"I handled it, go back to sleep." says Aleks, he throws a little wood on the fire and watches it crackle. He goes over and wakes the boy "Hey. you need to be nicer." he says, met with a dirty look. "I'm serious, you being tied up all the time is gonna get you killed, What if I make you a deal? I'll teach you martial arts if you PROMISE to be nice. no hitting, no spitting. Okay?" The boy thinks on it for a bit and shrugs</p><p>"Okay" he says. Aleks unties his hands and spits in his own palm, holding it out to shake "shake on it, so if you break your promise I can kill you." says Aleks, the boy shakes "By the way, what's your name?" asks Aleks</p><p>"Lucifer." says the boy. Aleks chuckles and waves him over</p><p>"we'll start tonight." Aleks says, smiling and readying himself "Okay, first thing I'm gonna teach you is how to fight with your fists and kicks. It's not the first choice to take down a zombie but you never know when you might need to protect someone." Aleks show the proper way to throw a punch, along with keeping his arms up and knees bent "Alright, now hit with all you got!" Aleks says. Lucifer hits him in the stomach "okay, you need to follow through, put your weight into it!" Lucifer does so, nearly knocking Aleks back "Okay good, keep going" They train until sunrise, as the sun crests the sand Aleks wakes Shade up "It's about time we got moving." he says, she slowly awakens and stretches. They take down their makeshift door and pack it away</p><p>"why is he untied" asks Shade</p><p>"I made him promise to be nice" Aleks says, Shade gives Lucifer a dirty look as they start walking</p><p>"His name is Lucifer. How far is this settlement of yours?"</p><p>"Lucy eh?" she laughs "It's about 3 hours walk from here."</p><p>Aleks nods and pulls out a cigarette, passing one to Lucifer.</p><p>"what he cant smoke! he's like, 11!" Shade says trying to snatch it away, Lucifer runs to the other side of Aleks.</p><p>"Oh, just let him, who knows when the kid could die" Aleks says, Shade looks madly at him but doesnt stop him. Aleks inhales and listens to Lucifer cough, laughing a bit "slow down kiddo." He says, they walk for hours to the settlement. Looking in, Aleks sees someone coming towards the large iron gate, as they are let in they are checked for bites or scratches.</p><p>"Shower?" Asks Aleks, Shade leads him and Lucifer to a large room</p><p>"clothes off, its a community shower, gotta save water ya know" She says, they listen and grab towels. The water was warm and felt great.</p><p>"Its been at least a year since my last shower" sighs Aleks happily, Lucifer stares at Shade as she washes herself. When they finish Shade hands them both clean clothes and leads them to her room "you two will bunk with me, we're a little low on beds." She says, an air mattress lays on the floor in between two beds.</p><p>"I call the bed!" says Aleks, Lucifer pouts. "Now then, I need some water and food."</p><p>"Lunch will be soon, you'll hear the bell, for now I need some sleep." Says Shade, Laying down, Aleks takes Lucifer out to explore, finding the mess hall, a structure that <br>the settlement keeps their things of use at, Akejs gets a carton of cigs and heads back to the room while Lucifer plays with the other kids, soon a church bell rings and Shade takes Aleks to the messhall, everyone gets a bottle of water and a plate of food, Aleks and Lucifer eat quickly, heading back to the room after, Aleks lights up a smoke and passes one to Lucifer, Laying back and closing his eyes. He wakes when the door opens and Shade smiles "Hey guys." Aleks waves and sits up</p><p>"So what is there to do around here?"</p><p>"not much, mostly read, tomorrow we'll go out and scavenge, maybe find some more supplies. We are low on water and medications." Shade says. Aleks nods</p><p>"But what now, I mean, dont you guys have like a generator and some movies or something?"</p><p>"A generator but no gas for it" Shade says, Aleks nods</p><p>The rest of the day is relatively boring until Aleks finds an old punching bag and trains Lucifer on his punches again. They go to bed late in the night.</p><p>End Day 3</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><p>alrighty that's my story and I'm stickin to it. <br>message me how you like it, I love feedback.</p>

                <p>So here's day 4 and 5. after tonights attack my town will be on day 6 so I'll write day 6.</p><p>Day 4-5</p><br><p>Aleks rubs his eyes as he wakes, hanging his legs off the bed he grab his cigarettes and lights one up. Looking around the room he stands and dresses himself, walking outside and looking around, Shade yawns. Someone comes over "Is Shade awake? Her father didn't come back yesterday"</p><p>"he didn't make it, our truck rolled and he passed" Aleks says, the man nods and walks into the room</p><p>"Shade, Shade!" he says, she jerks awake.</p><p>"Wha, huh, I'm up" she says before yawning and stretching</p><p>"we're low on medical supplies, can you get a scav team together?" he asks. Shade nods and stands up, putting on her shoes and walking over to Aleks "comeon guy, you're coming with me, we need medical supplies." she says to Aleks, he nods and grabs a backpack as they head toward the gate.<br>As they walk out Shade look at him "Most of the places nearby have been depleted. we either have to go far away, or try the mall. but it's always been to dangerous." she says<br>"Sounds fun, lets go on a shopping spree" Aleks laughs, They walk for an hour before seeing anything, it's an old gas station "Want some candy?" Aleks asks Shade, she laughs "Spree if you can find some." Aleks runs up and searches the store through the windows, there isnt much, the aisles all offcenter and destroyed, barren besides behind the counter "you might be in luck, they might have some in the back" Aleks say, he runs in and hops the counter, heading to the back room,slowly opening the door there is one zed, Aleks runs forward and it swings, scratching Aleks' shoulder, Aleks kicks him into the back wall and it drops, a swift kick breaks its neck and Aleks looks at his wound "shit..." he says, covering it with his shirt, he grabs what he came for and heads out without a word.<br>They approach the mall supercenter, deserted for the most part. walking up to an entrance a large crowd of Zeds is seen inside, just past the doors "comeon, we can find a safer place to ind stuff" says Shade</p><p>"Nah, we can do this. Lets find another way in" Aleks says, Shade rolls her eyes and they start to circle the building, coming to the central air unit "See? a vent, we can get in through that" Aleks runs over and starts to remove the cover on the vent, going into it, Shade follows, pulling the cover back on so as not to attract attention. crawling through the vent stank of dead and rotting flesh, and was cramped, finding another vent cover he looks around, seems to be inside a macy's. everything in the store is in tact, aleks kicks the cover off and drops down with a grin, Shade jumps and Aleks catches her, setting her down</p><p>"were are all the zombies?" Shade asks, a little worried</p><p>"at the front of the store. lets go" Aleks says, running out of the store and scanning the surrounding concessions and runs to the sporting goods store, grabbing a metal display hockey stick "cool" he says as shade grabs a baseball bat, they run to a large superstore, and start to the back pharmacy. Shade jumps the counter and looks through all the prescribed drugs, Aleks checks his shoulder, the scratch is puffy and leaks a green fluid, he gulps and covers it before grabbing painkillers and antibiotics, they load up their packs and start out, they way they came is now crowded with Zeds, shuffling towards them. the first thing Aleks notices is the smell, some of them have flesh dropping off their bodies as they walk, Aleks grabs s+Shade and ducks behind a checkout "what to do, what to do?" he says.</p><p>"they seem to just be passing by, lets wait" Shade says, keeping low, it takes a while but finally after an hour the group passes "god, they're so slow" Shade says as they walk. Aleks stays silent as he thinks about his wound, he'd never pass the check to get inside he settlment. He would walk her there and then leave. They come to the vent and go in, coming out outside, they cover it again and start the trek back, Aleks' shoulder throbs, they get to the settlement and he passes his backpack through the gate "what are you doing?" Shade asks, silently he shows the scratch, now black and purple, oozing green and yellow, Shade gasps "no...No you cant!" Shade says, nearing tears. <br>Aleks shakes his head "No, don't do that Shade. Be strong, you need to lead these people. I knew this could happen, it was bound to." Aleks says, he turns and walks towards the desert, the sun starts to set as he find a cave and stumbles in, out of breath and in pain. <br>Aleks collapses on the cave floor, gasping for air, he grips his shoulder in agony and cries out, curling up he spasms and his eyes glaze over, passing out.</p><br><p>End Day 4</p><br><br><p>Aleks groans as he gets up, holding his head in pain, he looks at his shoulder, the scratch small adn healing nicely, he looks around seeing nothing "wha?" He steps out of the cave and stretches, wondering what to o now, he walks towards the settlement, obviously yesterday was a fluke, or his body fought off the infection. walking up to the gate he looks in "HEY! someone wanna let me in?" he calls out. Shade runs over, it's obvious she didnt sleep well, if at all. "a...Aleks? Is it really you? you should be dead by now!" she says</p><p>"I guess my body fought it off. can i come in?" Aleks asks, Shade shakes her head</p><p>"lemme see the scratch" She says, Aleks shows a near completely healed scratch, Shade opens the gate and hugs him, as she does Aleks realizes he's hungry, he smells Shade and tries to resist taking a bite, his head fogs and he groans, Shade cries into Aleks' shoulder and he gulps "food?" he asks, Shade grabs a sandwich bag and hands it to him, he scarfs it down, Shade leads him inside and takes him to her room, She gave herself to him at that moment (I'm not telling that part of the story, I dont wanna get banned for life for sexual content) <br>Shade holds the blanket up over her shoulders and sighs happily satisfied, Aleks stretches and stands, lighting a cigarette "Im gonna go get some water." Aleks smiles and heads to the well, he grabs a bottle and takes a sip, a stinging burn in his throat and he spits it back out, his tongue bleeds a little before healing and he gasps. He brings a water to SHade and decides it'd be better not to tell anyone, he steps in with a false smile and tosses her the bottle. The dinner bell rings and they both get dressed, going to the large table, they sit and a man stands and smiles "I see Aleks is doing good. He seems to be immune to the virus. On that note, the scav party did good yesterday, we have the medications needed to keep us going for months. I'd say its good enough to break out our reserves, dont you Shade?" She smiles and nods. everyone is passed a fifth of alcohol. "Close the gates now, tonight we celebrate!" Shade says.<br>After dinner everyone heads to town square to celebrte, dancing and music everywhere, Aleks finished his drink before everyone else and Shade leads him back to the room where he passes out next to her, his hunger for flesh takes over and he stands, Shade is asleep as he makes his way silently out the window, he walks to the outskirts of the square as people dance, he watches and sees someone stray, probably heading to their house, Aleks makes his move and runs over silently, tackling them into their house, not giving him the chance to scream for help as Aleks rips into his flesh, Aleks fills his belly and belches before standing. He comes to his senses and realizes what has happened "Oh no... god no." Aleks thinks for a while and grabs a backpack, packing the remains inside and cleans the blood on the floor along with his face and clothes, when he is doen there is no trace of an attack, let alone a devouring. he takes the remains to a watchtower and heaves the bag over the wall, into the garbage dump before heading back to the room and curling up next to Shade</p><br><p>End Day 5</p>

                <p>I'm not much of a writer, but here's a start to mine:</p><p><strong>Part One of Many</strong></p><p>Ping. The sound of another arrival. Nobody was ever quite sure why it was a ping. Why not a bong, a click, a whistle, the creak of planks or a clang of metal? But it was a ping. The sound of another doomed soul.<br>The new arrival opened his eyes. A very rickety fence, a ruined field, thirty-nine sleeping bags, each with it’s own share of the thirty-nine survivors taking refuge inside the four wooden walls. It all seemed so familiar to the new arrival. He looked to his feet, clad in the brown cloth shoes so common in this desert. This desert, that never progressed, never changed, this desert that only seemed, to be.<br>Beside his feet lay two small items. A box, with a strange array of stamps, labels, scribbles and dents, much heavier than it's appearance would ever suggest. Atop the box, lay a bag. He picked it up. “Mac’s Atomic Café. Home of the Reactor Cola and the Radio-burger!” Strange. He didn’t remember ever visiting any café, and certainly not ever picking up some oddly-named cheeseburger. Peeling off the sticky label holding the bag shut, he peered inside, then pulled out a mouldy ham sandwich. Why did this smell… familiar?<br>He looked around again. He knew none of the people, but for some reason he recognized the twisted planks and the tufts of brown, dead grass. The poorly barricaded gate, the dirty well, and those sleeping bags. He was certain he’d never come across these before, yet he just knew that they were familiar. The synapses in his mind sparked, memories of ancestors making subtle suggestions and drawing links between things his eyes had never set themselves on before. But they weren’t his family or friends. Those memories were his own, from days and weeks past, the many lives lost in the shattered sands that used to house so many men and women, reduced to rotting corpses dragging themselves toward the remaining civilizations.<br>Counting the heads, he was sure there were thirty-nine people, including himself here. The number forty floated through his subconscious, stabbing the ‘important button’. He dismissed it. Forty can’t be important, he thought; it’s not like anything will change. Besides, people don’t just appear. How would they get through that closed gate? As he went to find a place to set down and take a look at this mysterious box, he didn’t notice the faint ping. The fortieth that this little town had heard over the last six hours.</p>
