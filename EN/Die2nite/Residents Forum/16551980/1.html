The squatter does it again!" </strong> Others exclaimed.</p><p>Out of his many Nicknames: <br>"Ghost" <em>(The name he had adopted when the World went straight to hell)</em></p><p>"The Chef" <em>(Based on all the wonderous meals he has created. He takes a liking to cooking it seems. Well, as far as cooking goes when you use moldy bread and sand as main ingredients.)</em></p><p>"Cattle Thief" <em>(He never seemed to hesitate taking items from the dead.)</em></p><p>And then his most recent Nickname, Squatter... He was not fond of it, but he did enjoy camping. And he was good at it to.</p><p>In any means, it was time to crack open this new Blueprint, and see what he had discovered!<br>After hours of trying to figure out what it meant, there was a message found on the back of the Blueprint. It read:</p><p><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">PROPERTY OF VILE DUNE.<br>WHAT THE WASTES HAVE YIELDED US SHALL PROSPER IN OUR HANDS.<br>WE WILL NOT FALL.</span></span></p><p>Vile Dune?<br>That sounded... Familiar. A rush of feelings. A short lived take. Knowledge.</p><p><em>Snap out of it!</em> Ghost thought to himself, ripping off the small corner of the map with the side note, and burning it in the candle next to him.</p><p>After a day or so of deep thought, the plans had been deciphered! They were:</p><p><em>A... nuclear Reactor?</em></p><p>The residents decided to go for it. The power would no doubt bring them success in living a prosperous and long life within the wastes.<br>A week went on. Makeshift capacitors were duck-taped to supermagnets, which were set into place with stones, while the reactor, made up of everyday supplies, was all suspended with wood beams and more duct tape. The whole thing was just a mess. But it would work. It had to. <br>But that is just when things started to get bad. <em>Very bad.</em></p><p>As one of the construction workers carried a heavy haul of wrought Iron, he dropped it. Hitting into the not-yet-working reactor, the iron was vaporized. Not to mention his arm.<br>As the mutilated man squirmed and screamed on the ground, the reactor tipped over, and chaos began.</p><p>Settling down, it was decided that a new Blue Print was needed to fix this mess. And only one person here could do just that...</p><p>As Ghost looked back, he saw his fellow residents waving at him. Something told him that he should not return. That a danger awaited him...</p><br><br><p>That night, Ghost camped out at an old Silo. And when he woke up, something strange sat next to him. A crow.</p><p>The red Beady eyes glanced at him, then in the direction towards town.</p><p>The ground shook, and what happened next was foggy and unclear.</p><p>All that Ghost knows, is that when he next woke up, he was sitting in a tipped Silo, and the land all around him had been replaced with a green foggish setting.</p><br><br><p>His memory became clear. he was not sure from where, or what, but he knew what had happened. <em>The reactor Blew.</em></p><p>Now Ghost was left to wander the wastes. Only he knew what power that blueprint had held. And he intended to use it.</p>

I can feel the energy of the dead. Are you the ones who contacted me for this dire ritual? If so, then let us begin.</p><p>First, let us chant a prayer, and call for the soul of the person you want to contact. And... Yes. I can feel it. I know because <span class="tid_strike">I ingested some funny mushrooms</span> I can feel their psychic energy. Right now I can feel the presence of someone who departed already. I am watching the soul of someone they called <span class="tid_user tid_user_3931022 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="3931022">Griffonn</span>.</p><p>I can feel that this person... has transcended the bounds of time and space, but has not shown an extraordinary growth. This soul is used to reincarnate, but is still unpolished. Yes, it still needs to <span class="tid_strike">get more SP</span> grow stronger.</p><p>I can see that <span class="tid_user tid_user_3931022 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="3931022">Griffonn</span> was not the kind of person who didn't want to get his hands dirty, but was not a gung-ho worker either. Can you feel the smell of concrete and molten steel? He was a worker when he needed to. That must be why people called him the Labourer.</p><p>I can see a vision. I see angry people. Neighbors maybe? I can see an argument, and Griffon being banished by a community a couple of times. I also see that Griffon enjoyed outdoor activities, including camping, expeditions and reckless fighting. Perhaps that is the reason for many painful, premature deaths?</p><p>What is this? The spirits are whispering to me. Griffon was an athletic soul that participated in the Apocalympics, whatever that is.</p><p>And... That is all for now. My Spiritual Energy needs to be restored. By the way, you owe me a Wad of Cash for the help.</p>

Then sit down. </em></p><p><em>Ive only met her in person once, but she is someone you don't easily forget. Her eyes are one of the main features you ought to know about her. Some say eyes are "<strong>gates into the soul</strong>" Her eyes invade the people she converses with, like a needle they pierce and study your reactions. You feel that it is rather hopeless to complain or compete with her. Recently she has put on a mask, but even behind this mystic accessory, you can still feel her piercing stare. Hehehe.</em></p><p><em>She has a rather enchanting voice, and a well rationed sanity. She seems to have kept it (somewhat) together through this hellish environment, which is more then most of us can say for ourselves. She has a passion for her crib, and keeps her mind massaged in relics of old. But does her need for these decore cost her neighbours? Some say that their own "trinkets" have mysteriously disappeared in her alluring presence.<br><br> She has participated in the constructions of many extreme and eccentric projects. She is crafty and creative, and not afraid to get her hands dirty. Although she takes pride in resisting the demons that have mounted many of our backs, <strong>twinoid is taboo</strong> to this strong willed maiden. But no one is truly clean, and once in a while a "hit" is necessary for survival.<br><br>Through her years of struggle against certain and undeniable death, her physique has remained youthful and desirable. But do not be deceived by her appearance. Her soul is catastrophic, it yearns with the desire to live, to escape, to finally be free of this corrupt punishment. She has made it farther then most, and has been the last of many. She has become a link between the dead and the living, relieving pained souls from their body's through blessed water. Her link has become powerful enough for her to summon upon the guidance of legends, she has become what I like to call, <strong>a proven hero</strong>.</em></p><p><strong><em>Godspeed Empress</em></strong><em>,</em> <strong><em>May</em></strong> <em><strong>The Raven King</strong></em> <strong><em>Be Merciful.</em></strong></p>
