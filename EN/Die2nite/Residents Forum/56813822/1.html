                <p><strong>Which Event would you like to have and participate in in Die2Nite in first week of January 2017? </strong></p><ul><li><strong> 1- Game of Thrones Themed Event Town</strong>: <br>this would be the 3rd GOT Town , you would have to be a GOT fan to join by either watching at least few seasons of the TV show or have read some of the Books, it will be a Role Play town where each player of the 40 will get a character from the show they either get assigned according to what they preferred in sign up , or randomly. it will of course be a long wonder town but the main goal of it is the forum games and role play during it in forum and IRC chat.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>2- Project "Leap of Faith" Town(s)</strong>: <br>where one or several towns of a mix of 30 sign ups join a random town and work with 10 unknown randoms to give them the experience of better random towns and also learn how to work with randoms peacefully and in a friendly way without any shunning or hanging. <br>the date of the towns will be set in private after the sign up list closes so no one would interfere to try to be one of the 10 randoms, it will be almost 100% leap of faith. <br>all sign ups will be welcome and its just to have the experience of the mix of both sides and to work together peacefully yet have better results and commitment than in random towns.<br>and of course the fun part about this will be if we manage to build several towns which can compete with their results in-spite jumping in different dates. its more like an experiment to try out what meta-cap could be like in the current conditions of the game and also to maybe help some random players see more of the game than what they see in random towns. <strong><em>if it turns out to be a success this can be run on a monthly or every 2 months basis.</em></strong></li></ul><ul><li><strong>3- Battle of Classes (new Version of Clash of Titans)</strong>:<br>its a newly formed Mode of the clash of titans idea with new rules and ways which allow residents to participate in it not as an only residents town but be part of each class town. there will not be a full resident town! it is made like this to adapt with the state of the server and numbers of players in it.<ul><li>it will be a 4 x Teams Competition (160 sign ups are required regardless if they are all residents or heroes)</li><li>each team town gets one of the following 4 classes assigned <strong><em>(Survivalists, Tamers, Guardians , Technicians ONLY)</em></strong> (there will Not be a Resident or a Scout or a Scavenger Team because first we need to maximize the number of heroes in each town to make it more fun and long, and second those 3 classes have no real chances of competing) (i am simply not interested in organizing a boring event for some and fun for others, so if you dont like it that those 3 classes are missing DO NOT sign up!)</li><li>All sign Ups will have to list the Order of all 4 classes they wish to play from favorite to least favorite. for example (1- Survivalists, 2- Guardians, 3- tamers, 4- Techs) OR select the option "i dont care where i land". i will then try to give each sign up their first or 2nd option and rest will be randomized. (no guarantees of course)</li><li>All Heroes participating in each team Must select the class their team got assigned! (if anyone will pick a different class they are not allowed to pick, they will be shot in the head and killed by the crows in the first 3 days or so and banned from any future Events Organized by Dream, sorry gotta respect the rules to make it fair).</li><li>All Heroes who signed up will be divided in 4 towns Equally (if we get for example 60 heroes signed up then each town will have 15 heroes and 25 residents) and the rest of the slots remaining open will be filled with Residents who signed up according to the class they Preferred or randomly.</li><li>Giving a Brother in Arms hero day to a Resident is 100% allowed and the resident is also allowed to pick any different class than the class of their team. so DONT ASK QUESTIONS about this please , BiA Hero days are an exception to pick a different class than your team´s class.</li><li>Residents who won hero days from LMS or Ghoul hero days Can pick any class , BUT they MUST report that they have those hero days before the event starts and ALSO sign up as resident and not as a hero!.</li><li>All who may decide to buy hero days or MT-Passes or get gifted MT-Passes during the event MUST pick the class of their team. period. if a new hero appear for 2 days in a row with a different class than their team and it turns out not to be a BiA on 3rd day they will also be risking getting shot in the head and killed by the crows for breaking the rules of the event. (if you dont like it , DO NOT sign up)</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><strong>4- The Ultimate Fighting Distinction Whore Event:</strong><br>this could be a competition between several Die2Nite teams built from sign up list OR half metas inside Di2Nite server and maybe also competing with the french Server Hordes. the other Servers from German and Spanish servers could roll with it too if they want as long they have someone to do all the organizing work from their side and have an external application similar to MapViwer for tracking. (Spanish server doesnt have one so idk and wont check it if its not in english ).<ul><li>it will be a competition of teams built from sign up lists (no restrictions of heroes or residents or anything) how to build the teams is debatable, no need to be super fair here since its about luck and fun .</li><li>the competition will last exactly 1 month (31 days starting from a set date in first week of January)</li><li>During the full duration of the 31 days the team/server with the most Wonders and Reactor Explosions Built during those 31 days Regardless of how many towns they play will be the winner. which means after building each wonder or reactor they have the option to suicide and re-jump again to start a new town. (all towns will be full so there will be no spoiling the game for randoms here!)</li><li>this will be tracked from mapviewer in D2N and BigBrother in Hordes. (i did not ask anyone in hordes if they like this idea at all, and i will not ask at all until i see the result of this poll first)</li></ul></li></ul><p><img src="//data-arkadeo.twinoid.com/file/336_4926.png" alt=":ark_game9_completed_1:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data-arkadeo.twinoid.com/file/336_4926.png" alt=":ark_game9_completed_1:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data-arkadeo.twinoid.com/file/336_4926.png" alt=":ark_game9_completed_1:" class="tid_ico"><br><span class="tid_preRoleplay">The Poll</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay"><strong>please do not vote before you read the details of each option!</strong><br><a target="_blank" href="https://twinoid.com/ev/56813404">You can Vote here </a></span></span><br><img src="//data-arkadeo.twinoid.com/file/336_4926.png" alt=":ark_game9_completed_1:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data-arkadeo.twinoid.com/file/336_4926.png" alt=":ark_game9_completed_1:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data-arkadeo.twinoid.com/file/336_4926.png" alt=":ark_game9_completed_1:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong><em>ALL Towns which will be run in all the 4 options mentioned above will be ONLY Distant Large Maps (NO HC or Private or Small Towns!)</em></strong></p><p><strong>there is also no guarantee i will organize any of those events depending on Real life in 2017, , but for now i would like to know what the majority prefer and the number of voters we will get which also will be a deciding factor. <br>so i ask all of you to please not ask anyone to vote from outside die2nite , i intentionally will hide the results of the poll in the next 7 days or so so no one would go crazy asking others to vote for their option. i need a real result that reflects what the community really would like.</strong></p><p><strong><em>there will be no prizes or distinctions to win for the winners of any of those events , its all for fun.<br>unless MT wakes up and sponsor one by contacting me in twinoid about it. and if anyone other than MT wish to donate anything please do not contact me in twinoid messages, just drop a line here.</em></strong></p><p><img src="//data-arkadeo.twinoid.com/file/336_4926.png" alt=":ark_game9_completed_1:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data-arkadeo.twinoid.com/file/336_4926.png" alt=":ark_game9_completed_1:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data-arkadeo.twinoid.com/file/336_4926.png" alt=":ark_game9_completed_1:" class="tid_ico"><br><strong>there is a Rule in this Thread that all must stick to or risk getting reported to crows and possibly banned from posting in forum: no one is allowed to go off topic AT ALL or Insult in any Negative way (you have been warned)</strong> you can suggest or add all you want , just be constructive , not negative or unhelpful.<br><img src="//data-arkadeo.twinoid.com/file/336_4926.png" alt=":ark_game9_completed_1:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data-arkadeo.twinoid.com/file/336_4926.png" alt=":ark_game9_completed_1:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data-arkadeo.twinoid.com/file/336_4926.png" alt=":ark_game9_completed_1:" class="tid_ico"><br>thanks</p>

BUT the 30 def from shield and 4% safety remain. tested and confirmed... after BiA town lost exactly those 8 def points once the BiA guard was on watch.</p><p>as for Battle of Classes. you most likely know it but i will say it anyway. CoTT 3 will never ever happen in Die2Nite, its simply too late to have that many Heroes in D2N. so i thought its time for a new idea with new rules that could make everyone happy , not just 40 people. we cant forbid any town from having a tech for the ruin doors. in this new version the skill of players combined with their class and how to get the max out of it will decide the win , not the class and some luck. that is the goal from my perspective. and that is why i prefer to allow BiA/LMS/Ghoul Heroes to pick other classes mainly for the Explorable ruin dilemma.</p>

                <p>So you are more towards my original plan I described, <br>more survivalists (15-20) getting optimal camping chances <br>to avoid early deaths and more luck at getting wonders found early.</p><p>I was explaining a possible tactic that some team might use <br>assuming they have a low amount of survivalists on their team... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink2.png" alt=":wink:" class="tid_ico"><br>like less than 8 survivalists...</p><p>But this wonder event sounds to me like a survivalist CoTTs<br> "<strong>lucky find of very rare</strong>" competition with some tamers,<br>technicians, scouts and residents allowed on the low end...</p><p>Basically, it would be like building a half-zoo or french zoo<br>until both SAC are found then deplete ruin and build all <br>and rince/repeat, unless you go for Architect Study level 3<br> upgrades... depending on early <strong>Järpen Table</strong> luck...</p><p>So yeah 4-5 days town x 5-6 towns...</p><p><strong>WHERE DO YOU GET THE IDEA THAT SOMEONE MUST BE SACRIFIECED?</strong></p><p>For some simple reasons:</p><p>1) You don't have enough boosters for everyone<br>2) The ruin is not reachable without boosters<br>3) Low scavenging activity and / or low chat activity<br>4) You don't want to waste 2-4 days to deplete the explorable ruin</p><p>5) You go 90% camping chance near ruin (Plan B) <br>to forcefully depleted the ruin in a single day, <br>unless all heroes can all waste their HR... (Plan A)<br>because both SAC finding was on the early lucky side.</p><p>6) You send one tamer to get that very rare before attack and build.<br>7) Some 90% camper dies without picto, but who cares?<br>8 ) Rest of town quickly build the wonder next day or that day<br>9 ) Everyone suicide next day</p><p>Remember the event is about getting many towns * wonders <br>within ~30 days, not getting longevity wonder town with many wonder in one of such town.</p><p>Not every META has <strong>6FO / RFM / Unnamed / Hive </strong>level of activity, <br>even in L2G most town chats were empty or very silent,<br>so in those case you <em>cut corners</em> to get <em>something done</em>.</p><p>Unless you want this to be "<strong>top meta players</strong>" only event,<br>then that would be a totally different event<br>than say any half-meta allowed or MMJ/L2G kind. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink2.png" alt=":wink:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>But yes, <strong>I agree with you</strong> a good planner with a <strong>chat full of active people</strong> shouldn't have to sacrifice any player except for that reactor meaty bone...</p>

                <p>that is a good loophole you found, thanks, but here is my opinion why it doesnt matter much:</p><p>anyone who gets BiAed to pick a different class than their team is 100% allowed to buy hero days or use 15 hero days Mt-Passes any time they want afterwards. <br>but they have to proof that they started as a resident and the next day when they run out of the BiA hero day or the day after they must show the organizers via Mapviewer that they are back to resident class again. <br>this will tell me that they didnt buy hero days to pick their class which they will be stuck with for the rest of town which doesnt match the class of their team. and 100% they got BiAed at first. once i see that if they decide to buy hero days then the rules allows it, i know it may sound like creating an advantage for the team , but given previous experience we should never put a rule that prevents anyone from buying hero days in events to avoid facing the fact that "we are forbidding people from buying hero days"</p><p>about the unfair advantage: there are very few who start residents and then decide to buy hero days or get MT-Passes donated to them or cashed from Arkado and kadokado... in this game. most are either already heroes or they get donated MT-Passes. the number of residents who just decide to buy hero days in an event from their own money is so low it is close to non-existence (there are few, but they are not that many to create an advantage that could decide who may win in my opinion),</p><p>and from my side i would love to encourage anyone to buy hero days even if it means creating small advantages, that could only be good for the server and the 39 other players playing with that person who suddenly decides this game is worth spending some money in it.</p><p>if they wish to create an advantage to their team after they start as residents and get BiAed i believe they are allowed to do it knowing there arnt many who could afford doing it and it will not have a negative effect on the event because i mentioned that this will not be CoT 3, it will be an event where skill combined with the class each team gets that will decide the win, along with the fact that hopefully each team will get 20 heroes assigned.</p><p><strong><em>however if the majority think and vote for not allowing this advantage i am open to disallow it, but remember the goal of this event is to have fun and to to enjoy a new type of event to the fullest regardless under which rules in the hope of waking up interests of all kind of players old or new , meta or randoms to stick around and make D2N great again</em></strong> (couldn´t resist , this phrase is gold in this situation <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">).</p>
