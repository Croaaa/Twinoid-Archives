                <p><strong><em>here are All updated informations discovered about Shaman and Souls in season 12 and season 13:<br></em></strong></p><p><strong>How does the Shaman get selected?</strong></p><ul><li>in each new town the shaman gets elected on Day 2 after a voting system by all 40 citizens on day 1. and each time the current shaman dies the next day a new shaman election will start and the day after a new shaman will be assigned. this also means each town can only have one shaman at all times. <br>you can ellect Shaman on day 1 once the town is full with 40 citzens from the citizens list where you will find a new tab option called "elect a shaman" (or something similar , i never checked)</li></ul><p><strong>What are The Forms a Soul can take:</strong><br>each time a town has a death, a Blue Lost Soul gets generated outside in the Desert:</p><ul><li><strong><em>Blue Lost Souls</em></strong>: if someone dies <strong><em>Inside or Outside</em></strong> the town as a watchmen, dehydration, Infection, withdrawl, Poison, Eaten by zeds in town, camping outside or not camping at all, ALL those types of deaths will Generate a Blue <strong><em>Lost Soul</em></strong> in the desert next day. (Death by Poison or cyanide immediately generate a new lost souls in the same day of the death) <br>It is completely safe for anyone of any class shaman or not to pick up this types of souls without any need for an immunity from Mystic potions. they are harmless when picked up.</li><li><strong><em>Red Tortured Souls</em></strong>: this Form only appear in the game after a Blue Lost Soul transform over night into a Tortured Soul. (it takes 48 hours or more dependig on RNG to transform a soul from lost into a <strong><em>Tortured Soul</em></strong> ) <a target="_blank" href="http://embed.gyazo.com/3367e94b6fa751fe833742fc234e304f.png">Tortured Souls look like this </a> <br>this Form of Souls will kill the citizen which will attempt to pick them up immediately as if it was a poison AS LONG THE SOULS ARE OUTSIDE!!! anyone can safely pick up tortured souls inside the town walls.<br>BUT there are 2 Ways to avoid this death by either<ul><li>letting the shaman pick them up which will be immune to their effect because of the shamanic power, OR</li><li>letting any non-shaman citizen Drink a so called Mystic Potion or Shamanic Potion which can be made by the shaman in his home using 1 Soul Action and 1 water <a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/ce115d94bf5a86bc85e8be01f5e0a3e4.png">like this</a> and the person drinking it will become immune for <strong><em>the entire length of that town (not just 1 day) and allow him/her to pick any tortured Soul safely from that point on forward.</em></strong> here is the message you get after Drinking the <a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/4e37b99f0884c8e1babb00aa45706ece.png"> Mystic Potion</a> and here is the message you get when you successfully pick up a tortured Soul while being immune <a target="_blank" href="http://embed.gyazo.com/bb585008efd6fa6ccf396e5e679ff17f.png">here Picking up a red tortured Soul</a><br>THEN once the red tortured Soul is collected and put in the bank Anyone in town <a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/4efcae029314b93f446bc19985c22d52.png">can touch the Red Tortured Soul in town from bank safely WITHOUT the need for drinking a Mystic Potion.</a> Red Tortured Souls are only dangerous to pick up outside!!!</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Why does each town get a shaman and what can this Skill/class Do and why it is one of the most important Job in each town?</strong></p><ul><li>A Shaman can see all souls regardless of their current FORM at all times even after they have been picked up and dropped again . they will be hovering in a square of 4 zones, and the Soul will always be in the lower right zone of that square. the shaman can see the souls under unvisited zones so it is no longer needed to open the entire map by walking through all zones as it was the case in previous seasons.<br><a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/cd72cfe349d3523118c3a7a8fdb40aec.png">shaman can see the souls under unvisited zones as well</a></li></ul><p><strong>Once the shaman gets elected on day 2 he/she will have a daily <a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/c9e65c5f9c4c0d37571428e657ce08ac.png">5 Soul Action Points</a> and here is what the shaman can do with them:</strong></p><ul><li><a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/b3a69ce4217b79a97fc6bf8e5b1134ff.png">Making it Rain</a> : at the town´s Gates which has a 75%+ chance (not 100% tested but who cares , its free water) to add 5 water to the well. and this action costs 3 Soul Action Points which means it can and must be done only once daily. or the other option is make it rain on the zeds outside which can kill some of them but this is considered a total waste compared to adding water to the well at the gates!.</li><li><a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/ce115d94bf5a86bc85e8be01f5e0a3e4.png">Brew a Shamanic Potion</a> this requires 1 Soul Action Point and 1 water and it can be done up to 5 times daily. this potion must be drank as a replacement for daily water when a non-shaman needs to pick up and collect a red tortured Soul to avoid immediate death and become immune for <strong><em>the entire length of that town (not just 1 day)</em></strong>. and a reminder if you drink this Mystic Potion you will regain 6 normal AP and refreshed status , BUT at the cost of no longer being able to drink water again to regain another 6 AP on that day. so its a simple exact replacement for water except giving the bonus of immunity against tortured Souls.</li><li>shaman can pick up tortured Souls without any risk for death or the need to drink a mystic Potion and they are the only person in each town that can carry several souls of any form at once in their rucksacks. <a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/afc8e81e39014c4c11dadd409b0cd5e1.png">a shaman carrying 2 souls at once in rucksack</a>. And here you can see that <a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/cf572fda1c73825cdff431b4d4178e98.png">Non-shaman classes still as before can not carry 2 souls at once</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/38b33a287bc0e9d89f916e2437a4196f.png">Healing illness and other statuses</a> , it can fail or succeed and sometimes the illness gets transformed to the shaman. not very interesting for testing since it has small chances to succeed to cure only (terror, infection , drugged state and injuries) , it CAN NOT cure dehydration or being hooked.</li></ul><p><strong>What are the effects of NOT purifying and having/leaving a tortured soul outside in the desert over night or Inside in the bank, someone´s Chest or someone´s Rucksack?</strong></p><ul><li><strong><em>leaving one or several Red Tortured Souls outside or inside in Bank, Chests , or Rucksacks WILL increase the size of the attack by X = 7.5% for each red tortured Soul left Not Purified over night</em></strong>. it will be visible by an increased change of all attack estimation numbers from the 30% to 100% and it will increase with the X factor of the size of the actual attack.<br><strong><em>this factor is confirmed from a very mmall data base to be X = 7.5% of the actual size of the attack.</em></strong><br>so to make it simple in an example: if you have an attack size of 100 zombies (best estimation here, not maximum estimation) and you leave one red tortured Soul Not Purified before the attack then your attack size will automatically become 107.5 which is 100 + 7.5% of the 100.<br>and if you leave 2 red Tortured souls Not Purified the attack size will increase from 100 to 115, if you leave 10 red souls Not Purified the attack will increase from 100% to 175% to go from 100 to 175.</li></ul><p><strong>Will the 7.5% increase of the attack size for each Tortured Soul outside or inside disappear after Purifying those Souls on the same Day?</strong></p><ul><li>Yes , this penalty will disappear immediately in the same second you purify them .</li></ul><p><strong>What are the effects of NOT purifying Blue Lost Souls before the attack by leaving them OUTSIDE in the desert or INSIDE the town in Bank , someone´s rucksack, someone´s Chest over night?</strong></p><ul><li>if you Do Not purify Blue Lost Soul before each attack which looks like <a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/c3f620fc41e648281c1096ced7cbdb00.png">This</a> then they Will have a chance to transform into a Red Tortured wherever they are after 48 hours from being generated. <br>to avoid this Transformation all you need to do is simply Purify all Blue Lost Soul which get generated in your town no matter where they are outside or inside. <br>you will have the option to Purify Souls from anyone´s Home After you build the project called <strong><em>Hammam</em></strong> by clicking at the "Purify the Soul" which will give you a message like <a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/710fca838b5615da77b60e40e3df75fa.png">This</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>Where do Lost Souls get generated after each death?</strong><br>since season 12 the souls will get generated no longer randomly at any location on the map but instead they will be generated at specific KM ranges related to the current day. it has been confirmed that souls land at the following ranges on the first 5 days like this: (and remember its never AP range but KM range that always matter!)</p><ul><li>Day 2 deaths generate lost souls at 4km range (or 5 km at the axis)</li><li>Day 3 deaths generate lost souls at 5 to 6 km range.</li><li>Day 4 deaths generate lost souls between 6 to 7 km range.</li><li>Day 5 deaths generate lost souls between 7 and 8 km range.</li><li>Day 6 deaths generate lost souls between 8 and 9 km</li><li>after day 6 there is no need to test since its most likely either too late in an inactive town or doesnt matter in an active one.</li></ul><p><strong>Distinctions:</strong></p><ul><li>for each Soul of any form purified in each town each still living citizen gets a distiction (i think its called mystic points)</li><li>for each Soul a person purifies by clicking at "purify this souls" from home that person alone gets a distinctiopn called (Soul collecter)</li></ul>

                <p>before season 9 or 10 the distinction "Soul collector" was awarded to those who pick up a lost soul generated in the world beyond for the first time before anyone else touch it.</p><p>in season 11 it was changed and it is still the same afterwards in season 12 and 13 which is: <br>you can only get the distinction "Soul Collector" if you are the one who purifies the soul from your home.</p>

                <p>A question: In my all experience of being a Shaman in multiple towns I've never saw a tortured (red) soul appear on the mini map. I wonder maybe they mask themselves as blue souls or not?</p><p>I know they look red when on ground or in inventory or in bank, but what about the minimap when Shaman's looking at it from town/? Red as well?</p>

                <p>first , the Shaman only can see the location of Souls ONLY, they never have a skill or the ability to determine weather the Soul is lost soul or has transformed.</p><p>BUT all blue lost Souls have a chance (a % which is unknown, lets call it 50% for the fun of it) of transforming into a red tortured Soul after exactly 48 hours,(2 days after the soul has been generated) <br>NOW after 3 days of leaving a blue lost Soul outside or un-purified (72 hours) you can safely assume 100% that the Soul is red tortured Soul after keeping track when it has been generated and where.</p>
