I, lived in a time of darkness and despair. You could say that it was the darkest days of mankind. I lived in a town with four other friends, among fourty people, always struggling to survive against "them". But one day, the unthinkable happened. One night, when fending off against the attack, "they" made it over our walls. To put it in the simplest way I can, it was a complete massacre. A lot of people died that day; I don't know how many, but me and four other people escaped the carnage together. As the night wore on, we struggled to find a place we could hide at. We ran, and kept running, because it was night time and we knew those things wouldn't be far away from us. A lot of times, I almost gave up hope. But looking at the four people that were with me, that were supporting me, that I was supporting, I knew I needed to go on.<br> It was early morning when they finally stopped. We spent a little while to catch our breath from that horrific night. As far as we knew, everyone from our town was gone, and there was nothing to go back to. But looking up, Dirk had spotted something we could go to. The town that he had found was quite abandoned and empty, but unlike our old town, it was still standing. Looking around, we found that there were about 4 people who had been there before us. They had told us a similar story about how they had run away from the carnage and destruction of their town. Slowly throughout the day, people came to the town seeking refuge. A few people stayed behind to work on building important construction projects, while a lot of us went out to find materials and food. We were lucky, because the town seemed like it had water for several days, unlike my group's previous town that had already had a quickly dwindling water supply.</p>

                <p>After some discussion in town, it was quickly agreed upon creating a text form of communication that could be used even if one was outside of town. We called this method of communication the town forum. I quickly found that there were a variety of uses for the town forum. For example, in my exploration, I found myself trapped by a group of eight of "them". They were quite docile, but I knew from experience, that as soon as I tried anything, that they would attack me. I put a message on the town forum asking for help, and very quickly, a small group came out of town to assist me. What I couldn't handle alone, we were able to hold off together. <br> After the situation was under control, we realized that we were standing upon the grounds of an old abandoned construction site. A place like this would likely be a treasure trove of building materials. At the least, much more supple than trying to scour the barren wasteland. So we all searched around a number of hours before we decided it would be best to head back. I can't exactly say our town will never need anything again, but we came back with a full load from our trip.<br>Back in town, I found that a number of things were going on for those who had worked hard and were resting for the day. There were training seminars going on in teaching other residents how to efficiently search for materials out in the wasteland, and seminars about what to do if they ever missed gate closing time. Along with that, there were also different games of cards going on, such as poker, Black Jack, and a coin guessing game. It seemed like everyone was working well together and having fun together. At that time, I was actually pretty bushed myself, so I dumped my find into the town bank, and went to join the others in some black jack and poker before the night ended. <br> While walking back from the poker table, I notticed an ad on the town forum for people to join the watchmen. There was no payment offered really, unless you counted security. I was pretty tired, but I didn't want this town to end up like my old one. So I signed up.<br>The attack that night was quite brutal. One after another, they came at us, piling over each other to try to get over the walls of our town. Unfortunately, that ended up working. A small number of them got over our town walls, and it was now time for the watchmen to keep them away from the rest of the town; this included me. None of us really had a weapon, but we fought hard to fight for everyone's lives. It felt like forever, but finally morning came, and they mysteriously just left.<br> Checking the town newspaper, which was made by a couple citizens that weren't on watch, I checked the survivor count. Everyone in town had survived an attack; that is only people who were in town survived. Unfortunately, there were 3 people who had been outside town when the gate had been closed who hadn't made it through the night. It was sad, really, that we lost 3 people all in one night. But, for the 37 people that were still in town, we had to keep on going.This is the story of our dull gray lives in t he Arcane Junctions.<br>-The ManInGray</p>

After all, I'd rather leave this all behind forever myself. But in the end, this is still where I am. This second day for the most part was rather uneventful. There are only a few small points to bring up today. Everyone seems to be cooperating more smoothly than the first day. With everyone working together in groups, no one seemed to get into a dangerous situation.</p><p>However, near the end of the day there was a little bit of trouble. There were four different people outside, and the gates were going to be closed in less than twenty minutes. The worst part is, one of them was a member of my coalition. Vyooloo had just been speaking to everyone over the town forum a few minutes before, but suddenly, she wasn't responding to me when I called her to come back. At that point, I became worried. But, a hero by the name of Steef understood what had happened, and performed a truly heroic rescue, bringing her back to town.</p><p>After that, there were only three people outside. I continued calling out to those people, telling them that it was getting really late, but only one of them responded. His full name is LostAlien, but most people just call him lost. Lost is another one of those spectacular heroes, but probably also one of those crazy ones. I mean, he was insane enough to actually decide he wanted to stay out over night. He wasn't giving up, he truly thought he stood a chance being out over night. He said he had found a building that he thought there would be a helpful blueprint is. I don't know if that's true, but he's supposedly a trained survivalist, so I just decided to hope that he'd be alright.</p><p>In the end, Lost ended up being amazing, rather than crazy. Looking at the daily morning newspaper, I looked to see who had made it through the night. With our defenses, "they" didn't even make it past our walls. As for those outside, Lost did in fact make it through the night, and even crazier, ended up finding that blueprint he was looking for. Too bad I couldn't say the same for the others who spent the night out doors. According to the Gazette, neither of them made it through the night. I don't know exactly what happened, but I do know that they won't be coming back anytime soon. I guess it's time to work on getting Lost out of the world beyond before he gets himself killed. It's a bit of a pain to try to figure this all out sometimes, but I guess that's just a part of my dull gray life.</p><p>Residents Dead: 5<br>Residents left: 35</p><p>-The ManInGray</p>

Things started out business as usual as I left town to begin my search in the world beyond our little town. It felt like a very satisfying day until it began to end.</p><p>Heading back into the town, I performed my daily ritual of checking to see if anyone was still outside of town. There was only about an hour left, so it was dangerous for anyone to stay outside of the town. On the map, I saw that there were about 4 people outside of town still which worried me. One was Lost, who had already been camping out the night before. He was planning on a second night in a row because he suspected another set of blue prints. I decided to myself that if he made it again, I'd take a drink with him when he got back. Anyone that hard core deserves a little something for t he risks they take. Looking at the other three names that weren't checked into town yet, my face paled as I saw one particular name.</p><p>A member of my coalition, Vyooloo was once again outside of town. There was no message from her, so I was sure that there was something wrong. People wanted to help her and the others that were stuck inside, but we just weren't able to get to them. To top it off, another member of my coalition, Dirk, found a mysterious letter from a person he was sure was his uncle, with a message that his uncle was in danger. He knew the dangers of leaving the town, but he decided that he had to go to his uncle no matter what. So with the decision to leave our coalition, likely for good, Dirk set out for the sake of family.</p><p>Really, the end result of the night was quite horrible. Even though I managed to save a person by the name of Greggy, there was still a large amount of victims in the end. A small number of people in town had lost hope, and simply hadn't drank any water in two days, and they died of dehydration. Another 3 people, including my friend Vyooloo disappeared in the middle of the night. Vyoo probably isn't dead, I kept telling myself that. She was pretty good at hiding, she was probably out there some where. But with "them" closing in towards our town, she probably doesn't have a way to get back to us. Wherever she is, I hope she's okay. We lost 10 people tonight, and things seem like they're only going to get worse from now on.</p><p>Residents Dead: 15<br>Residents Left: 25</p><p>-The ManInGray</p>

                <p>Arcane Junctions - Day 4</p><p>Available Coalition Members: <br>Lyzan<br>CprlKirk<br>ManInGray</p><p>To the Future of Mankind if There is One,</p><p>This is the first day after our coalition members Vyooloo and Dirk had left us. Things seemed almost like the other day hadn't happened, if it wasn't for the fact that those two weren't around anymore. I hated to say it, but we had to move on and get back to work. Even if we wanted to take a break to mourn them, "they" never take a break. They'd be there tonight like usual.<br> <br> Looking at the usual town forums, I saw that Lost had amazingly survived another night out and was looking for a group of people to go with him to another ruin site. I have to say, Lost was busy taking all sorts of risks, but it seemed like he knew what he was doing. So with another resident, I volunteered to go with him.</p><p>Heading out to the site we were supposed to meet him out, Lost started directing us east of our current location. Halfway to our site, Lost decided it would be best to stop for a break. I wasn't quite tired, but I imagined that all his trips he'd been taking had to be tiring, so I didn't mind it so much. The trip itself was kind of surreal, as if I hadn't been there for it. We just got to the site, searched, and went back like there was nothing to worry about. Overall, I found today to be rather normal and uneventful. After what had happened last night, it seemed kind of strange that a day could actually go by without worry. It's too bad that I probably won't have many days like this. I looked at the Gazette after the night's attack, only one person died tonight. But at the same time, I guess every person counts. I guess, let's just see what the coming day brings us.</p><p>Residents Dead: 16<br>Residents Left: 24</p><p>-The ManInGray</p>

                <p>Thanks. This is for a competition mostly, but getting a compliment never hurts my ego! &gt;: D</p><p>Arcane Junctions - Day 5</p><p>Available Coalition Members: <br>Lyzan<br>CprlKirk<br>ManInGray</p><p>To the Future of Mankind if There is One,</p><br><p>Today was a particularly stressful day for me. I went to the Watchtower to see how many of "them" would be around for the night's attack, and I saw that there was a scarily large spike of "them" around the town today. Tonight's attack was estimated to be at...569. That was at least a jump of 100 from the last night. After everyone in turn confirmed this, people started panicking about what to do. Lost, Lyzan and a fellow resident named Gunelash stayed calm and decided to use their time wisely be pushing out another expedition to a ruins in hopes of finding good supplies. But for the most part, there was a lot of panic in town.</p><p>In order to meet the oncoming threat, those of us who managed not to make it into the panic stage agreed to work on a construction project based on a set of blueprints Lost had found, called Evolutive Walls. These walls, even I have to admit, are an impressive piece of work that after its initial completion allows the town to improve even further without having to use any extra supplies, and barely any effort. However, it seems its completion simply wasn't to be, tonight.</p><p>People started little construction projects making their homes more...tangible, buildings shacks and actual houses in hope that their homes would be less of an option for the zombies to attack, and even some braver citizens were picking up as many weapons as they could from the town bank. After talking with these people, we were able to calm down everyone, and convinced them to put anything we didn't need back into the bank. The damage was already done on the shacks and houses though, so there was no going back on the building supplies we had lost.</p><p>In the end though, we were able to make it through the attack even despite the earlier set backs. Lost and the others came back with a few nice additions to our building supplies, and we had a record high in wathmen. With so many people helping out this time, we were pretty much able to hold them back.</p><p>When I say pretty much, that's because not everyone made it. TOshokking, a hero who had been quite active in our town discussions, and had been a member of the watch lost his life during the attack. Many of "them" attacked TOshokking, and he disappeared before my eyes. It's quite sad really, because with his kitchen, he made pretty much the most amazing food I've ever had. You could say it was so good that it was even a little energizing. But I suppose that doesn't make much of a difference now considering the lack of food coming into town. But not having food isn't anything that new to me, considering there was never much food in the last town I lived in. That's just how it is in my dull gray life I guess.</p><p>Residents Dead: 17<br>Residents Left: 22</p><p>-The ManInGray</p>

                <p>Not quite. Dirk_Strider is no longer in the Coalition. Although I put it in one of my entries before, I didn't take out the death count for it. After he left, he wasn't able to complete the town, se he dehydrated. But considering in my entry he "left town", I decided it would be best to make sure the count of living citizens was accurate, even if he wasn't playing anymore. So I waited until he actually died to include him in the death count.</p>

Today seemed to be going rather well. Everyone, at least who talked on the town forums seemed to be busy, all doing their parts. Everyone was working hard to find supplies, or convert supplies we already had in order to make the Evolutive Wall. We had a major setback yesterday when we lost a lot of supplies on panicked constructions, but today everyone was working hard to make up for lost time on it....and man did we work hard. I searched for supplies nearby town close to where people at watch would be able to pull me in with a rigging contraption we had set up about a kilometer away from town. I would've gone further out, but our town's water reserves are getting dangerously low now. Quite a few people have tried to warn everyone that at this point, we need to ration our water even further than we previously had before, or risk dying of thirst. But it seemed like everyone was ignoring us, as when I looked at our water supplies in the well, we only had three rations of water left. We started with around 25 rations of water today, and now we only have three. I convinced everyone to vote in the daily town meeting for the town effort of upgrading our pump, but with only 20 extra rations of water coming out of that, we can only last so long, as long as everyone keeps drinking all the water like this.</p><p>If that wasn't bad enough, we lost two people today. The first was a resident named Methodeck. I didn't really know much about the guy. He didn't work in the work shop, he never went out to search for supplies....really, he was a pretty quiet guy. I would assume he helped in the construction projects, but spending most of my time in the world beyond, I honestly have no idea if he even did that.</p><p>While Methodeck was an enigma that I, honestly have to say I won't miss much, we did lose someone very important to the town today. After taking all those risks thus far, it seems like Lost finally ran out of luck. He'd come back from another expedition, when he saw that there was a call for help in the world beyond. He immediately ran out there in order to help the person that had been stuck outside. The person had quite literally ran out of energy, becoming so tired, hungry and thirsty, that his body just wouldn't respond. Lost ran out there to help him, despite how tired he already was, and tried to use his survival book to find some water for the man. Unfortunately, he realized all too late that the tips for finding supplies out in the world beyond didn't apply so close to civilization, and he knew only one of them would be making it back to town that night. He selflessly gave the citizen his last ration of water, and bid everyone else ado. We must continue to survive, but Lost will be missed.</p><p>Residents Dead: 21<br>Residents Left: 19</p><p>-The ManInGray</p>

I went out earlier to try to find as many building supplies as I can before the night comes. Tonight, there's supposed to be almost seven hundred of them. Not quite that much, but still a lot of them. Anyways, as I was saying, I went out into the world beyond in order to find some supplies for our next construction project, Armored Wall V3. This construction idea was a combination of the wooden armored wall and iron one that we've already made. This thing should really help in the future.</p><p>Unlucky me, I couldn't find anything at all out there. Do you know how frustrating it is to search for hours on end without finding a single thing? I didn't before, but I sure do now. I'll tell you, it's the feeling of uselessness.</p><p>Frustrated with it all, I went back inside and worked in the town to help with the building. I converted some scrap metal into useable iron, then went onto the big construction scene to help put the actual thing up. After a lot of work, I felt satisfied that I at least did something. Well, I wish I could say that, but not really being much of a construction person, I made much less progress than everyone else. Like I said, it's a really bad day for me today. Maybe if I get lucky, tomorrow will be better.</p><p>In any case, I'm feeling pretty good about tonight's attack. There's so many watchmen here that none of those things should get into our town. I'm pretty sure my luck's turned around at this point, and I'll have a much better day tomorrow. Oh, hold on a second, they're starting to get over the walls. I'll put my pen down for a moment and be right back.</p>

                <p>Arcane Junctions - Day 8</p><p>Available Coalition Members<br><strong>CprlKirk<br>Lyzan</strong></p><p>To the future of mankind... but I don't think there'll even be one now,</p><p>Last night attack was one of the longest that'd happened to our town. What usually took them seven minutes now took them nine, or maybe more, I wasn't sure. Obviously, some struggling had taken place. I shared the same fate as eight others this morning; finding myself in a terrorized state. Voices echoed within the skull of my head, images of their dark set of teeth and their rough-edged fingernails flashed before my eyes as they seemed to reach out for me and my limbs simply couldn't stop shaking. It was a close encounter and nothing like how they were in the daytime.</p><p>I am Lyzan, an acquaintance to ManInGray. I happened to come across his journal when I visited his room, right after I'd gotten a grip of myself. He was gone by the time I reached there. Checking the town's gazette, I learned that there's thirteen of us left and also saw the names of those whose body was taken outside. Gray, was on that list. Climbing up the watch-tower with sadness on my expression, I scanned the surroundings. Approximately over six hundred of them had gathered.</p><p>Our chance now lies beyond the safety of our walls, I thought. Staying here any longer would be suicidal. So I told them to conserve their strength, to take some rations and some defensive objects with them for their campsite. I headed south myself with the intention to have those terrorized follow my trail as I take the zombies on. I cleared the first two zones with ease but I ran into trouble on the third. I ran out of water-bombs and had broke the hurling stick. Things weren't looking good for me. An abandoned construction site was just ahead. That's where I was headed to, thinking that the structure could at least hide us from tonight's attack. Time was running out; for me at least, and I couldn't afford risking myself to be stranded and rest without setting up a camp.</p><p>So I did what I wouldn't quite encourage others to do, I fled the zone. It was a desperate move. In my attempt to escape, I was scratched on a wrist pretty deep. Reaching the targeted site, I started working on a particular hiding spot. I warned the others about the overwhelming numbers before my current location then so they wouldn't be trapped. But I was a tad too late, CprlKirk was right on my trail along with one other. A few more of our people were scattered to the west while a handful decided to remain in the town. Wishing the best to everyone, I went into hiding way before it'd gotten dark. With the faintest of light, I wrote and continued this journal to honor those who'd struggled with us along the way. Without them, we couldn't have made it this far. I may not be able to write again tomorrow though. With my wound and the lingering threats that were moaning outside, I saw no hope.</p><p>No hope at all.</p><p>~Lyzan</p>

                <p>Town: None</p><p>Oh lookie here, I didn't expect to find my journal out here. For a bout two our three days now, I've been hiding out in a ruins somewhere away from town. The night I left, they had been getting over the walls in droves. There were so many more of them than I had expected. Almost right after contact with the first one of those "things", I understood that what I was trying to do was worse than an uphill battle; It was pretty much suicide.</p><p>The other watchmen would be here soon to help the few of us here, but I knew by then that it would be far too late for me. So I did the only thing a coward like me could do; I ran. Dropping my weapon, I ran as hard and fast as I could to stay out of the reach of those things I knew were there.</p><p>My plan was that I'd use the system that we used to pull citizens into town, to get out. Hurriedly, I climbed my way up the watch tower, almost losing my footing a couple times in my panic. But I managed to make it to the top of the tower where the system was. I looked down and paled as I saw them climbing on top of each other to get up the tower. It would probably take a while for them to get to me because so few were actually after me.</p><p>But I knew they still would, and that on one's own, it could take a very long time to pull the carriage across the rope to the other side. After a pain inducing excruciating effort that felt like a life time, I'd finally made it across. Every second I had been pulling myself along, I had to keep looking back hoping that they weren't climbing across the rope to grab me. I mean, I know that they don't have enough balance to, but at times like this, logic like that just doesn't make it into your head.</p><p>Two days later, here I am living off of some unmentionable food even worse than what was often brought back to town. According to what I've read in my journal, Lyzan was the one to pick it up. His entry couldn't have happened that long ago. Maybe, just maybe, he's still nearby. I can't wait any longer to go look for him. Next time I write anything will be when I'm somewhere safe. Some place nice and warm would be nice. But I guess I can't ask for that. I guess I should feel lucky enough to even be here still.</p><p>-The ManInGray</p>
