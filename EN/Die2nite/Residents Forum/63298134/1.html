                <p>Hey guys, this thread will be used to keep track of the <strong>2019's MMJ Scavenger Hunt event</strong>. Here you can ask questions about it, post your achievements' proofs and discuss anything related to it. But before we start let's leave a few things clear:</p><p><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"> <em><strong>What is the MMJ Scav. Hunt event?</strong></em><br>This is a side event that will be going on concomitantly with MMJ towns staring now at August 17. It consists of a series of <strong>Individual </strong>and <strong>Town </strong>related achievements that will give you points. All MMJ players are participating on this; all it takes for you to participate <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScNm3xW6vg2h5Or8Etz4nEuKgBloHmCvHjL2saValpgSEVsxg/viewform">is to enter your name at the MMJ form</a> (if you haven't yet) and make it to one of the MMJ towns during the jump.</p><p><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"> <em><strong>Town related Achievements (TRA)</strong></em><br>There are 28 Achievements in total, divided in 2 groups. The Town achievements are points generated by achievements completed by the MMJ town you are in right now. So lots of team work is required to get them. The TRA are:<br><em><br>Uh this post was too long so i'll list the TRAs on the next post...</em><br> <br><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"> <em><strong>Individual related Achievements (IRA)</strong></em><br>The IRAs are things only you can get, although you can get help from your fellow town members to receive them. Most of these achievements require a screenshot proof posted here in order to be counted. The IRAs are:</p><p><em>Also on the next post ...<br></em><br><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"> <em><strong>Proof of Achievement</strong></em><br>To get one achievement you sometimes need to screenshot something and post at the MMJ Scav. Hunt thread (this one!). Make sure your screenshot contains all the information required for it and that it shows the d2n clock showing your town name and current day of the town. You don't need to post the screenshot in the same day, but i advise people to not take so long to do it so the points are counted soon and the leaderboards of the event are more accurate.</p><p>I know some of you play in the phone and it might be hard to produce the evidence and show the clock at the same time, but no problem; if it takes more than one screenshot to do this job then go ahead and post as many as you need.</p><p>As for where upload your screenies, you can go ahead and upload them at the Discord channel of the event, get the link, and post here. You are free to use any other image upload platforms you prefer too.</p><p>Another important thing to remember is to log in at the Oval Office and update it in order for us to see how your town is going. You can find the link to the Oval Office at he Directory menu (top left icon thingie <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_sites.gif" alt=":hordes_annu:" class="tid_ico">).</p><p><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"> <em><strong>Tracking the progress of the Scav.

It also has a general leaderboards too. If you hover/tooltip your mouse over the achievement category images you can see more information about them.</p><p>The points and achievements will be manually added for <strong><em>EACH </em></strong>person, so it may take a while till your points are accounted for.

Some of them are already being allocated to other side events related to MMJ and there might be other side events still to come during the towns. So the MTPasses as reward for the Scav Hunt you see there right now might change.

They are still in the lead but the margin now is lower if you consider all the other achievements that towns can get.</p><p>My idea with this achievement was to show other players the dedicated heroes we have and say "oh wow this dude played Tamer over 2000 times? Awesome". But ye... it would have been better if these heroes weren't concentrated in a single town, but in overall I think this Hunt is a bit more balanced now.</p>

I was so excited about this rrRRRAAAA</cite><p>Yeah you are right, maybe "balanced" isn't the right word.</p><p>What I meant with "balanced" is that, now with the nerfed points the other towns can try to catch up with them if they play better.</p><p>For example. Before the nerfed points the other towns would have to get 2.5 Wonders to catch up with town #2 initial points. Now a single Wonder can put them in the lead.</p><p>The weight of these 6 achievements now shouldn't affect much if you take all the other things the town can get + Individual achievements.</p><p>Jo asked me to come up with a Scav. Hunt event for this MMJ and I had to create one from scratch since the one we used before is based on a whole season length, not just one town length. This is the debut of this system and ofc I couldn't foresee many things that happened (and will surely happen).</p><p>Maybe next time someone want to use this event system for a MMJ they can replace these passive points I came up with since they aren't very "Huntable"; you simply get them depending where you land, where is the skill on that right? I was just thrilled with the idea of people getting to know the pro players we have when they inspect their points and see that some of them are coming from that awesome player that was a Hero for a long time.</p>

                <p>I have to partially agree with you on that one matsuuu, hanging me is indeed part of the game, and as Ace said "most d2n fun ive had in a while". The poor dude schemed to kill someone for the first time in his life! Big baby step right there, maybe that'll motivate him to join a random town and start doing the same on other people. So yes, I'm not bitching about that.</p><br><p>The issue here is that Miudo snitched. As the organizer I added him to our little chat, so that he would be able to appreciate the machination we were pulling to its fullest.</p><p>But guess what he did! He took screenshots and sent them to the other town citizens that weren't part of our little plot, he ofc especially picked the meta players that would be very very infuriated by what we were planning to do("How dare they scheme to kill people! that's not how die2nite is supposed to be played!" )</p><p>Basically he left his role as the organizer and became an active player in our town(which he isn't in). Which confirm the fact that he is definitively not an event organizer but just a fellow meta player informing his inbred fellows that active griefers are in their town.</p><br><p>Now concerning Saran, he follows me by himself. I give him no order, and even tho I throw him rock from time to time he just keeps going back. I'm starting to think he may in love with me.</p><p>Or maybe it's just friendship, you never know.</p>

                <p>Dude, there is a difference between an Authoritarian style of Leadership and a "fascist utilitarian dictator". I should know I've literally studied leadership for over 4 years. In the USA The Authority style of leadership is used in many everyday places, such as Schools, most business, the Military, the Police Force, etc. It is also used for taking command of a situation on the spot. For example, let's say there is a serious car accident and you run over to try to help the situation, you may tell someone to call an ambulance while telling someone else to check to see if anyone is in the car, or you may tell everyone to get back depending on the scenario. My point is, in that situation you don't have the time to stand around and ask every person what they think should happen, or how they would deal with it, or take a vote on what to do. You need to take immediate action to resolve the situation as quickly as possible. That's what I was doing in the MMJ town. There are very time-sensitive matters that need to be attended to in a D2N town. The first 3 days are the most important days, and what you do with those days will determine what happens in the town. That's why when someone with experience, that knows what needs to be done and how to do, needs to take charge and have the less experienced people complete those task, for the betterment of the town. Otherwise, the people that don't have a lot of experience will start doing random things that aren't benefitting the town. Therefore the most optimal way to lead a D2N town in the early stages with multiple inexperienced people is through the Authority Style of leadership.</p>

You should be ashamed that you confused my stance on metas to the point on confiding me into sharing your evil plans. The badass people on Hordes should totally learn about this; they are going to laugh at your sorry face for days.</p><p>MMJ IS NOT DGJ, Die2nite IS NOT Hordes. Here the evil people is good sometimes and you never see they coming. Snitching might be bad for a Hordes player like you, but this is piece of cake for us here. We have Evil Events for when we want to go and use the features this game provide for foul play and we do lots of crazy shit that would make your baguette shrink in fear.</p><p>Go home. You are not ready for Die2nite. And take Saran with you. You might need a girlfriend.</p>

                <p>Part 2<br>I wrote this 3 years ago, maybe it will help you understand.</p><p>What is Authoritarian leadership?”An authoritarian leadership style is exemplified when a leader dictates policies and procedures, decides what goals are to be achieved, and directs and controls all activities without any meaningful participation by the subordinates. Such a leader has full control of the team, leaving low autonomy within the group.<br>-There is also a clear divide between the leader and the followers.<br>Authoritarian leaders make decisions independently with little or no input from the rest of the group. Authoritarian leaders uphold control over their followers by directly regulating rules, methodologies, and actions. Authoritarian leaders construct gaps and build distance between themselves and their followers with the intention of stressing role distinctions. This type of leadership dates back to the earliest tribes and empires. It is often used in present-day when there is little room for error, such as construction jobs or manufacturing jobs.<br>-Authoritarian leadership is vital in many workplace environments. This style is necessary within organizations and companies that demand error-free outcomes. While authoritarian leadership is one of the least popular management styles, it’s also among the most common.<br>The authoritarian leadership process generally entails one person making all strategic decisions for subordinates. Although it has fallen out of favor in recent decades, the authoritarian leadership style is still prevalent. The reason is simple: It works.<br> <br>I feel like when most people hear Authoritarian leadership they think “communism” or dictators like the North Korea leaders or Hitler, but that's just not true, the authoritarian style is everywhere, like in school most jobs and even at your house. When I hear authoritarian style I think more of this 1 person knows more about this than anyone else, so why would you need the other people who don't know what they are doing to have a say in it? It's the most productive way to work.<br>The Learn to Lead book states this about authoritarian leadership, The authoritarian style is ideal when you have time limits or critical situations, or when individuals cannot respond to less direct approaches, For example, if you are at the scene of a car accident and a victim is about to die, then you give specific, direct orders that in a normal situation might seem rude-Get me a towel!, You! Hurry call 911 and Get over here now.<br>Similarly, if you are training some cadets who won't listen to your polite requests to stop horsing around then you might have to raise your tone, The caution with the authoritarian style is that if you overuse it, it becomes counterproductive because you are trying to motivate by installing fear.</p><br><p>PS sorry for all the bad grammar, this was just some of my notes for a speech I had to give.</p>

You don't need to post the screenshot in the same day, but i advise people to not take so long to do it so the points are counted soon and the leaderboards of the event are more accurate.</p><p>I know some of you play in the phone and it might be hard to produce the evidence and show the clock at the same time, but no problem; if it takes more than one screenshot to do this job then go ahead and post as many as you need.</p><br><br></cite>

But I was fed up.</p><p>I joined the MMJ hoping for a fun, light-hearted town, a chance to meet new people and make new friends. What I got instead was unwarranted toxicity.

And at the beginning, so did he and the zoo grew well,<br>But the center of the realm was not anymore in town, where all citizen were, but on Discord, where only some citizens went, discussed far from town, received some orders from the dead kings and unknown leaders.<br>For a while, things seemed going well&nbsp;: The zoo became the most beautiful of the universe, some were glad to kill being useful, others enjoyed being totally free and did what they wanted to do, hoping their city would win the contest.</p><p>However maybe the town leaders spent (too) much time on Discord, or on the World Forum, maybe they did not really look thoroughly at the real world (map, bank, personal logs). And a few citizens began to worry on the town forum&nbsp;: they asked questions, they regretted some mistakes, noticed the bank was poor, they did not understand why common BP were not read etc... In the «&nbsp;heavenly&nbsp;» atmosphere, these citizens seemed to look only after fights. They were just realist and worried&nbsp;:</p><p><strong>The zoo that should have been a tool had become an aim. </strong>(Even now, look at the last video joanne posted).<br>Scavenging was neglected, and the bank was poor (wood, iron, nuts and bolts were missing),<br>Many Aps and resources seemed wasted<br>Very soon, it seemed obvious to these citizens that the dumps - necessary when the watch in not powerful enough – could not be built&nbsp;, because there would not be enough objects to throw in dumps. (at day 21 the slaves have all the dumps built…, I’d like to compare their bank and ours now)</p><p>About me&nbsp;: I saw town forums more organized in random towns than in that MMJ town.<br>On day 14, when I proposed an expedition for 3 citizens <strong>inside the zoo without weapon</strong>, Joanne first approved, but Discord did not agree and she made a group of 2 that keep on making the zoo smaller with weapons, and it was impossible to fulfill my project, and discover the buried building ( 1 AP needed to unbury it, and at day 21 the building is still mysterious <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_lol.gif" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">)<br>This town became more and more boring and frustrating for me, and I began thinking of commit suicide - the stupid sachiko’s insults were the last straw.</p><p>About <span class="tid_user tid_user_8245653 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8245653">PalimPalimPalim</span> and <span class="tid_user tid_user_9829799 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="9829799">ChitaKillerdogg</span> (who invited me in her coa only for MMJ)&nbsp;: Yes I understand the ghoul killings seem horrible, -at least the Joanne’s killing- , but here they are accused by people who suddenly discover they may be multiple accounts, furthermore some blind people certainly did not see all what they did during 15 days, when they were good soldiers obeying orders&nbsp;: <br>their last deeds make them useful scapegoats, and they are used to hide the relative failure of a town, that should have done better if… <span class="tid_user tid_user_70794 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="70794">Dream</span> did not die, (or if he had died completely, being only a wonderful cheerleader), if <span class="tid_user tid_user_1946812 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1946812">matsuuu</span> and <span class="tid_user tid_user_6055872 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="6055872">shlominus</span> had become clearly new leaders, if Discord had not spread...discord, if the town drama had been solved by a fair referee, if... if....</p><p>Good luck to everyone.<br>I think the MMJ was an interesting experience.<br>End of story.</p>

You didn't see Palim and Chita insulting people left and right. No, you selectively chose to only see me retaliating after I'd already called for peace TWICE.</p><p>From Discord:</p><p>1st appeal (before <span class="tid_user tid_user_70794 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="70794">Dream</span> even died, so basically the first couple of days in town..) :<br><a href="http://prntscr.com/p32x4j" target="_blank">http://prntscr.com/p32x4j</a></p><p>2nd appeal:<br><a href="http://prntscr.com/p32urf" target="_blank">http://prntscr.com/p32urf</a></p><p>Just look at the dates.

                <p>It sounds like a kitchen cook fighting issue... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/hmm.png" alt=":-/" class="tid_ico"></p><p>People disagreeing on how to play the game <br><em>(hordes vs die2nite style)</em>.</p><p>Unable to communicate, so clearly some communication issues,<br>some were on discord chat, some were not,<br>some are simply not listening either <br>or clearly do not want to.</p><p>I guess continue communicating via a Town Twinoid thread<br>would have been helpful.</p><p>I also assume that not being "perfect" and dying early<br>makes a dead king methodology looks weak,<br>if you already have prejudices on his way of playing the game.</p><p>As for anyone from Hordes questioning zoo vs no-zoo,<br>there are several things that you need to know:</p><p><strong>Zoo</strong><br>1. Zooing cost lots of resource / AP / effort to build<br>2. Zooing is mostly useful in die2nite because 24 timezone issues<br>3. Once zoo is built, you go back to heavy scavenging / building to catch up.<br>4. Any person who is not hero with 7 items, means less items in bank during scavenging phase.<br>5. Any builder that does not use 18 AP and scrap with last AP means problems for Garbage Dump phase.<br>6. End game camping is easier with a full zoo, so you can move around freely.<br>7. Grabbing items far from town is easier with a zoo.<br>8. A centered map like yours makes zooing easier, <br>you just lacked AP / boosters / weapons, etc.</p><p><strong>No-Zoo</strong><br>1. Hordes used to zoo but they all play in 1-2 timezone, so having an expedition with 6 people is easier, because everyone is online at the EXACT same time.<br>2. You will barely ever see this on die2nite, because the games run 24/7 and expedition except maybe for 1-2 coalitions that are on the same timezone makes this very difficult.<br>3. Because you only kill to camp, you save some early items / AP, normally you would kill some spread but not be religious about it,<br>see INGSOC non-zoo method for die2nite.<br>4. INGSOC would kill some spread and zoo only when it's easy.<br>5. In your town, you even used the Jerrycan pump <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> on zooing that may be unwise if you ran out of water <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_water.gif" alt=":hordes_eau:" class="tid_ico"> later.

I know it had some bumps on the way and the points system needs more balance, but it was more or less entertaining for those that sought the achievements and that cooperated with their towns to get the most points possible. If anyone felt their town was harmed in any way because of this event feel free to post it here. I saw some comments about it on each town chat and I'm considering and respecting them. I'm really sorry your towns were affected this way if that was the case. It wasn't our intention to do so. This event was supposed to be fun and we still accomplished that I guess.</p><p>I'm sure next time we try an event like this we can apply some changes that were suggested along the entire MMJ and that can still be suggested. Please post here if you have any input.</p><p>Here is the place we are storing suggestions of changes and additions to this event format. Please contribute in this thread and check for the existing suggestions here:<br><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1130uk9LYx9An0dpVzsiCOXrBFP0VD6zh2LvwUCMWIVc/edit#gid=2043027306" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/...</a></p>
