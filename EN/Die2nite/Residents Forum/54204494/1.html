This one will actually require you to do some work in order to win (as opposed to <a target="_self" href="/tid/forum#!view/61490|thread/54201835">this one</a>, where all you have to do is say "I want to be in this" to be in the drawing).</p><p>Whoever wins this will get awarded 15 days in which they will be a hero. <span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay"><span class="tid_sideNote"><strong>ANYONE may enter this one, even if you are already a hero. The fifteen days will just be added to your current amount.</strong></span></span></span></p><p><em>You MAY enter this one </em>and<em> the other one (if you are a resident), but if you win one of them, you will not be eligible for the other.</em></p><br><p>Okay, so..here is the rules and it's very simple. Complete this questionaire. Whoever's opinions/answers match up the MOST with my own will win. <br>Best thing to do here is to fill out the survey honestly, with what your own true opinions are, and hope that they match up with mine..,<br>...however, if you want to try to answer them with HOW YOU THINK I THINK and despite what your own real opinions are, that's okay too.</p><p><strong>Feel free to have side conversations in this thread and debate/argue with others over their choices.

In the long run, what do you think is the most beneficial to build/have, a factory or an architect's study? Give your answer why. I know many of you will be tempted to say "It depends on other things", but answer it under the rule that all other factors are irrelevant and you have to go with what one you think is the best one, in general, <strong>under any conditions</strong>.<br><br>6. What do you think the best thing to get from an upgraded seeker's power is? Give your answer why. I know many of you will be tempted to say "It depends on other things", but answer it under the rule that all other factors are irrelevant and you have to go with what one you think is the best one, in general, <strong>under any conditions</strong>.<br><br>7. What heroic power (of the six that exist: Uppercut, Return, Rescue, Cheat death, Seeker, and Second lease) do you think is the overall best one and why?

                <p>I'm answering these from my random town experiences.</p><p>1. Best common would small cemetery, because cheap defence and many will die early.</p><p>2. Best uncommon would be third wall. Relatively cheap and good defence.</p><p>3. Best rare I think would be Eden project, apple tree or evolutive wall. It would depend town and it's situation.</p><p>4.Best Very rare, wonder wheel, because I haven't build it yet. Maybe best to achieve longer survival would be coffon catapult, especially if it is unlocked and built early.</p><p>5. Factory, meta towns will find lots of blueprints from other sources.</p><p>6.Best thing to seek: Full jerrycan, for water, or as ammo in jerrycan gun (this question was difficult)</p><p>7. Best heroic action: Heroic return, I can rescue myself from tough place and can go to longer distances to camp, without need of thinking how can I come back.</p><p>8. Best unlockable hero perk is the one(s) that increases inventory size.</p><p>9. Guardian is good class. More defence to town and more CP so you don't get stuck. And better watch defence.</p><p>10. I think there is already hero class for everything, but since developers are now excited about townroles, a new townrole who has camping survival bonus would be nice.</p>

                <p>From the longest town with the most people alive perspective</p><p>1. What common BP do you think is the most useless and why?<br>Small Cemetary - Even with all the data we have from the d2n apps Predictor is still real time game data given to you about your current town. Small Cemetary is simply the expected death toll points when you can no longer cover attack. The points wont matter people will still die and it wont change a thing.</p><p>2. Which uncommon best/useless why<br>best - Guard Tower - the DEF gain from gaurd tower/guitar combo with just 3 gaurds beats all but Weapons dump, more gaurds and it not even close.<br>useless - Peoples Court. The game tells us to organize 3 times before we play (once before we log in) this is a hint to know who you are jumping with.

                <p>Whoops... Here is the useless:</p><p>1. Common: Central Laboratory, there isn't even lab built in many towns</p><p>2. Uncommon: Shower, it doesn't do anything</p><p>3. Rare: Infirmary, healing costs too much, and towns don't have enough pharmas for it (someone always uses them) and meta towns don't need it.</p><p>4. Very rare: Cinema, it isn't even wonder and almost useless.</p><p>8. Clairvoyance is most useless. That upgraded version is much better. I don't have unlocked many yet so I don't know how well others are working.</p><p>9. Most useless hero class, maybe scavenger or tamer. It is easy and good hero xlass but others are needed more to certain tasks. Guardians to watchman, scouts to scout and get souls from middle of zombies, survivalist to camp, technician to open ruin doors. Scavenger finds more stuff and tamer can send stuff back to town, but tamers are used in meta towns to do some missions and that is why I choose Scavenger.</p>

                <p>In the view of a Meta Town (just cause its easier <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">)</p><p>1. Small Cemetary. The +10 Def/Citizen is not really worth it, especially if you're looking to get onto the leaderboards. By the time it provides lots of defense, there aren't really enough citizens for it to be worth it or the attacks will be massive compared to the defense it gives.</p><p>2. The most useful uncommon BP is probably Grabeboom. With it, you get a guarunteed 15 zombies killed per day (minimum) and a maximum of 45. From one BP. On top of that, you need to build Vegetable Plot so you get Intestine Melons as well. The most useless uncommon BP is probably the Ventilation System. Meta Towns probably aren't even going to build the Portal Lock, and it is pretty much negated after day 4 due to the teleport option from voting the watchtower up.</p><p>3. The best rare BP in my opinion is probably the Faucet. There are a lot of good rare BP's, but I think that the faucet is the most effective. A lot of towns tend to run into water problems (especially Hardcore) and this will cut down on the water usage (assuming they havn't had any other luck with buildings such as Eden Project/Divining Rockets). Later in the game, many towns rely on weapons such as MK2 and Aqua Splash/EWBs. The amount of water rations saved using Faucet can reach an insane amount, depending on how early this BP is found + built. The most useless rare BP is probably the Infirmary. Most Meta town's won't be getting people injured, and if they do, then they will have 2-3 bandages stored up in the bank. It is rare to run out of oxygen while running a ruin, and 99.99% of the time you won't ever have to run from zombies. In addition, the AP costs are massive, so you will spend all your AP just healing yourself. And in the event that someone gets and infection, pretty much all towns will have lots of paracetoids.</p><p>4. The (coolest) VR BP is probably builders merchant. The amount of times it is used to great effect is close to 0, since by the time everyone would be building palaces all the citizens would probably be camping out and about. <br>The most useful VRBP would probably be No Holes Barred. 150 rations of water is a lot. Even a town with all 40 citizens still alive would take 4 days to go through all of the water. It's a nice BP to have, and can help shift the focus of a town from water problems to keeping zombie numbers down.<br>I would have to say the most useless VR BP's would have to be all of the wonders. They serve no purpose (in my opinion) other than the distiction they give. There is no actual benefit from the wonders to the town (no defense, no nothing).</p><p>5. I would say that if there is a JT found day 1, then it should definitely be used to build the factory. In a Meta Town, the first 5 days are devoted to voting the watch tower anyways, so there wouldn't be any benefit to building Arch Study that early. In addition, hopefully (since you were lucky enough to get JT) you were also lucky enough to get the really good common BP's. Such as Searchtower and Veggie Plot.</p><p>6. The best item from an upgraded seeker would probably be BED. You can't really get anything bad from this item, and you also have the possibility of grabbing some really good items (N&amp;B, EC, Compact Detonator).</p><p>7. The best Hero Skill is Hero Return. It's the most useful one, especially for me. If I ever become a hero, its through a BiA. And that BiA is most often for a Scout Mission. That extra 11AP that Hero Return saves you lets you scout even further away and even more zones. The amount of buildings found on a scout run without Hero Return could well go from 2-4 to 0.</p><p>8. The most useless Hero Perk is probably Mayor. The only thing that this grants you is the ability to create private towns. These towns aren't even able to be ranked. If there was to be an event (such as the apocalympics) where private towns are needed, then it is possible for the admins to create them.</p><p>9. I think that survivalists are the best hero class. They are the reason that towns are able to get so many rare BPs, and they also help a ton in the making of a successful zoo. <br>The most useless hero class, in my opinion, would have to be scavenger. All other classes are very important in the ongoing of a town, while a scavenger just strolls out to the desert and depletes zones faster than residents <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"><br><span class="tid_wspoil"><span class="tid_user tid_user_4885636 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="4885636">isliceyobread</span> <span class="tid_user tid_user_1757235 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1757235">Sashimi</span> Look I learned <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_lol.gif" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></span></p><p>10.

(if surv camps at 100%, emulator camps at 100%, if surv camps at 10%, emulator camps at 10%... has same AS timer as scavenger while following them).<br>This probably would increase the amount of multi-accounts, but... seems like an OP class to me.</p>

Most useless uncommon BP is shower because it does nothing and takes up useful water.<br>Most helpful uncommon BP is grapeboom because you get free weapons everyday to scavenge and camp buildings easier.<br><br>3. Best rare BP is apple tree because you get free ap from the apples everyday. More ap=more constructions for anything else=town gets ahead of the zombie curve.<br>Most useless rare BP is free dump. It destroys items for little in return.<br><br>4. Best extremely rare BP is builders merchant because if everyone has more house defense, the town will last longer. This is one of the only extremely rare BP that isn't for a pure distinction at the end.<br>Most useless one is dump upgrade because dumping items is useless. You waste potential future days wasting items for little defense.<br><br>5. Factory is more useful because if all 40 heroes have architect skill, literally they will get every common BP anyway. If NONE of the heroes have the skill, the ap conversions down to 1 ap (with a hacksaw) will be useful anyway. BPs can be earned from ruins which most organized towns can do.<br><br>6. Mechanism in the hopes to get a nuts and bolts is the best choice. <br><br>7. Heroic return is the best one of them. Saving 10-11 ap is very useful and vital in long range scavenging missions metas do. In the event of a horde square, the hero would easily be able to suvive using heroic return. <br><br>8. Architect is the most useful because you can get all the common BPs in the game using it. Most useless is clairvoyance because who cares if someone is active or not? That will not change their activity level. You can already know what items someone has if you scoll over their house anyway. Useless skill...<br><br>9. Best hero class is survivalist no contest. This was already proven in clash of heroes when ALL survivalist towns beat the other classes. Their ability to get 100% camping in the late game is unrivaled. Who cares about the scavenger 30 minute less timer? Tamer is nice but generally it could be gone without. Guardian does have perks of house defense and watchman ability but camping they lose to the survivalist. Tech is only for keys in ruins which is useful but camping (end game town points) they lose to the survivalist. Scout ugh I'm biased towards it but it seems weak but I know it has merits. I just feel that snooping around in the WB isn't for me. <br><br>Worst hero class is scavenger. Every other class has a use that can greatly help the town.<br><br>10. The warlock. His ability is using 2 ap, he can take control of an inactive person and use their ap in constructions or workshop only (no walking into world beyond). He may only use this ability 1 hour or less before the attack to prevent using a potentially active person's ap. The warlock's pet imp can hold up to 2 items on its own. The imp finally gives the user a 10% accuracy boost in weapons. In a meta this hero class may not be as useful BUT in random towns just one warlock could be a godsend in not wasting valuable ap.</span></p>
