                <p>Can we just put like a massive red circle round the forums with a an arrow pointing to it with some massive text that covers up half the screen stating "READ THIS," because I really just don't know how some people don't manage to read the forums, but will have it in them to complain that "The gate keeper didnt close the fkn gates noob" when theyre dead because the gates were left open despite the fact Ive clearly stated in the forums that Im camping tonight and need someone else to do it.</p>

                <p>first welcome to the world forum,</p><p>there is no such thing as gatekeeper , no one should ever post "i am the gate keeper in any town" and also no one should ever trust or rely on any other person to be a trustworthy gatekeeper.</p><p>the concept of any town having gatekeeper is very primitive because this game is all about a team working as one unit (at least in first 5 to 10 days when LMS isnt possible). <br>if one unit of the team fails to be active during any time of need due to busy RL or other reasons like yours, there should always be other units standing by to be there when in need.</p><p>so you are to blame in the first place giving the newbies the impression that you are the gatekeeper. stop doing that and then your problem and theirs will no longer be an issue.</p><p>as for forum, yes it may sound like a good idea to make the forum an important big link to see. but each player already gets a notification link daily that they have to check the forum in their overview page right next to estimating the attack and voting for the daily town upgrade. SO if those players arnt smart enough or have enough online time to click there and read the forum then not even making the forum a Giant link would change that.</p><p>good luck</p>

I am not entirely to blame. Yes, it is a team-working game but like the heroes and vets who step up to herd the newbies sometimes someone has to take a role if no one else is willing. Otherwise the gates would have been left open every single night and everyone would have died. I don't consider that to be "solving the problem" unless you mean learning from experience.</p><p>Taking a role as gatekeeper would be considered helpful in most cases and by most people as it keeps continuity and makes things much easier. With a backup gate keeper it is unlikely to falter, however unfortunately in this situation it did and yet even with a full in game days warning none of the 18 citizens stepped up to close the gates when the time came and the town completely bombed. Its currently just me and another citizen left on day 4.</p><p>but even though I don't necessarily agree with everything you said I still appreciate you replying, its always nice to get other opinions on the matter, especially from a much much more experienced player than myself. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p>
