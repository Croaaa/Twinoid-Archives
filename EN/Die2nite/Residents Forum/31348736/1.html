                <p>Quite a few Die2Niters are part of the very large Mush Beta contingent. Others will get to play Mush soon when it's out (in English).</p><p><strong>This thread's about talking about Mush from a Die2Nite perspective</strong>.</p><p><em>Personally, I am struggling to get in to Mush. This should rejoice some of you, I know <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_blink.gif" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></em></p><p>I am first and foremost interested in the manipulation and deceit aspect of the game. On one hand it is cool that there is a set number of non-cooperative agents and it is especially relevant that you only benefit from "griefing" if you are Mush. This way, there is clearly nothing whatsoever to win if you're not Mush and you want to screw around.<br>There are quite a few times where Die2Nite could benefit from that, I guess.</p><p>You don't choose if you are going to co-operate or play selfish / grief. This also is kind of a cool idea.</p><p>What the falafel, I was sincerely planning on saying quite the opposite as I rather like the freedom of choosing how I will play each town and I was quite honestly planning on expressing my love of Die2Nite the way it is as opposed to Mush, ...but putting this down in words and I'm confusing myself.</p><p>What if something vaguely similar was introduced in Die2Nite, where a certain amount of players could be zombie enthusiasts and have a special interest in being selfish and griefing. As it is now, anyone can do it, get a set amount of specific distinctions - and any of us distinction whores will do it, and wheeeeeee.</p><p>But meh, how could it work. You'd have your fancy metas where players would admit they're the zombie enthusiast and agree to be used in a way that is beneficial for the town.</p><p>I guess having a mush like dynamic would only work with a meta cap.</p><p>Perhaps it's time to bring back the meta cap so Die2Nite can progress further.</p><p>The Cluedo like Mush hunt, in Mush, is excellent. Very much like the old selfish player hunt was at the start of Die2Nite. Nowadays it doesn't even matter as a few organised metas control the leaderboard through friendly and organised set play. It's nice for these players to get rewards for selfless, organised and mathematically sound moves, but it's also really boring unless you really like to control every factor as much as you can and get fancy spreadsheets. Some might call it anal, others would say houlala don't call me anal you big fat meanie.</p><p>It'd be cool to have more Die2Nite players and to get towns where you play selfish only if you draw a certain card, and the rest of the town is out there to work out who you are - and inactive, counter-productive players are, as a result, confusing.</p><p>Is there a bit of an idea for a new special event town here?</p>

In an ideal world, I'd do the opposite. Separate them off entirely. Let them go and play with their spreadsheets in a game of strategic resource management, while the rest of us play a social game of betrayal and negotiation. I only care about meta players as much as it affects non-meta towns. Really, I'd like to be able to actively choose not to play with meta players, but I'm not sure how you'd implement that.</p><p>The real problem though is that the selfish game in Die2Nite is simply too linear. Play for the town at the start, maybe hoarding a few exceptionally useful items. Wait for chaos. Stack up on DOs.</p><p>That's about it. There is, for example, almost never a good tactical reason to poison someone.</p><p>That's what needs fixing. Die2Nite should be based on the prisoner's dilemma, so you need far more situations where it's a choice between your own welfare and the towns. Admittedly, I don't hold out much hope for that ever happening.</p>

                <p>I think the main problem really is that you guys are trying to play different games. A meta player wants order and usefulness from the start, while Workshop and others would like to spend their days in drama and chaos (The archictecture in Die2Nite allows for both of these, so Workshop only wants a game Die2Nite COULD be, not that it can't). It's literally impossible to achieve these things at the same time, so probably the best thing Motion Twin could do is implement two join buttons. One for randoms and one for metas. Of course very few of the skilled players would/do join randoms so you usually get towns full of sheep, and it's not as fun to cause drama when you don't have people that actually care.</p>

The hero perks are really only a benefit in mass, for a meta that wants to win.</p><p>Anyway, I'll be sure to seek out organised mush ships and groups, whenever that starts up.</p>

                <p>Dahk.</p><p>The relationship I was speaking of refers to a player that wants to "win" by obtaining the rank 1 spot on the leaderboard. Which is something that cannot be done outside metaplay or without the teamwork of other heroes.</p><p>Die2nite at its heart is a game of math, and being a hero, playing with 39 other heroes is a huge mathematical advantage.</p><p>Organisation aside, a 40 hero town, is the best chance / enviroment, you have of taking the number 1 spot.</p><p>Thats not to say that you couldn't in theory obtain a rank 1 town, with some residents in it. However, should you be competeing against another meta with 40 heroes, each resident you have is quite simply a disadvantage.</p><p>Which is why, resident towns weren't allowed entry into clash of the titans, because they stood no chance of winning.</p><p>Sure a resident can take part in meta's and many do, being a resident doesn't indicate that you are a bad player, griefer, etc.</p><p>But it doesn't change the fact that the disadvantages of the resident class, becomes a disadvantage for the meta as a whole.</p><p>I can see your point about being a hero and gunning for LMS in random towns. Its definately the easier of the two "winning" distinctions to obtain.</p><p>But to me at least, Die2nites "grand prize" has always been the number 1 season ranking.</p>

                <p>Well here's something that I didn't really think about until just recently</p><p>In D2N, groups of players are called coalitions, which makes sense. In some other MT games, they're clans (which is also fine). But Mush has "castings"</p><p>For whatever reason, I looked at Spanish Mush, and I noticed that the area on my profile about castings says "Reality Shows". This caught my interest for two reasons: 1) why is there English on this Spanish game; 2) that translation seemed lazy. I then <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/casting">looked up</a> what a "casting" was, and came to the realization that znarf's translation is pretty good (to me, at least)</p><p>So basically, private ships are just dramatizations of what could happen? Without that "Spanish" translation, I wouldn't have thought of that at all, since it just seems entirely out of place</p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">I'm mainly posting this here since I don't care for Mush at all</span></p>

                <p>I skipped pages 2 and 3 to get to this point:</p><p>I'm part of the Mush-beta right now. But even if I weren't, I like the idea of a set number of ghouls to start the town. Like in Mush, where the Alpha-Mush are only chosen after all 16 crew members are thawed, the Alpha-Ghouls (2-3 in distant towns, 4-5 in hardcore towns) should be chosen only after all 40 citizens have joined the town, but the dynamic of the ghoul should be changed.</p><p>Rather than simply allowing ghouls to eat other citizens, perhaps add the option of nibbling another citizen (uses 1AP, and can only be done once each day by any ghoul, and only once each day to any human). After a few nibbles (4 in distant towns, 3 in hardcore), a human citizen becomes a ghoul. If there is anyone besides the ghoul and human victim, it will appear in the zone log, or if it happens in town at all, it will appear the the Great Register (subject to tampering like any other entry). Every ghoul can see who all the other ghouls are, but the humans are oblivious. (Poor, oblivious humans.<img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_ghoul.gif" alt=":hordes_ghoul:" class="tid_ico">)</p><p>Also, the dynamic surrounding punching a ghoul would have to be changed in order to prevent the humans from randomly punching everyone on Day 1 to kill the ghouls. Instead of instant death to ghouls, every punch should guarantee a wound to both the victim and assailant (eye/head wound to victim, and an arm wound to the assailant), but a ghoul's max AP would not be affected by the wound. That and the relative rarity of bandages should be enough of a deterrent to prevent random attacks to kill the ghouls early.</p><p><em>"But how would a human kill a ghoul?"</em><br>The same way you would kill a zombie - any weapon could be used against any citizen at an AP cost (1AP for water weapons or the cell phone, 2AP for blades of any sort, 3AP for any heavy item).</p><p>There could be ghoul-specific honors/distinctions/titles, such as for preventing a town from reaching Day 10, or the number of humans converted to ghouls. Just like a game of Mush ends if the only crew left alive are Mush, if the only citizens left alive are ghouls, then the town ends.</p><p>This could go places, but we must also keep in mind that the MT crew are responsible for a large number of games (and mini-games) in several different languages, so any drastic changes like this will likely take several seasons to properly code and test.</p>

                <p>So, my replies here are in response mainly to Worskhop always complaining about metas. I thought my responses were measured and calm, sometimes cheeky but they don't look that way. All the frustrations toward this person seem to be coming out but it's not cool to do it here. I'm sorry for speaking harshly.</p>

                <p>Even now after teasing them for years, I simply put a reference to the meta cap in a post about Mush or possible event towns and without fail they think the whole thread is about them. It's amazing.<br>I confess: yes I had them in mind when I decided to throw in the words "meta cap" in my original post - not because I want a meta cap to stop them enjoying the game but because I thought I was being funny (not just naturally good looking and suave) and I was wondering if, once again, they'd bite. This light hearted "trolling" is so old, I didn't actually believe it'd work yet again. Perhaps it is because they are on a mission to bully me on the forums at the moment?</p>

I also just gave away 45+ MT Passes to the judges and winners in the haiku contest. I wanted to do something nice for the community.

If it's about trolling me/us, I couldn't let you fail, now could I? Trolling gets my goat because usually it's not allowed. Not sure why Workshop gets away with it.

I do know what's detrimental for the forums and I see a lot of the people I play with helping on these forums.

                <p>Your authoritarian and intolerant interpretations of the forums rules have bothered many. Throwing in a reference to the meta cap as a joke is perfectly allowed but according to you, anything that is slightly against your gang, even in a joking manner, should be forbidden and punished. This is quite clear.</p>

Never used the code or entered the beta, though, since it was in French and I don't speak French and it wouldn't have helped them any at all, so it definitely isn't for actually playing in the French Mush Beta.

                <p>Looks like everything after the <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/freeticket.png" alt=":mush_ticket:" class="tid_ico"> icon is what you unlocked in your short time playing. <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Mush has an interest for me, what bothers me is the mechanics. It just doesn't feel like I'm really "doing" anything. So many actions cost AP, and several of them cost 2 AP per attempt and often have a low chance of success, leaving me to spend as much as half my AP or more before succeeding.</p><p>There's no reliable way to gain AP, either. Takes 3 hours to gain 1 AP (2 if you're lying down unless you're Chao), meaning once you're out, you're looking at a good 24 hour wait before you can try and do anything again.</p><p>I understand the game is part co-op and part PVP (humans versus mush thing), so limiting the actions to give both sides a fair chance is understandable. Kingdoms is pretty much straight PVP and has incredibly long waiting periods and for good/understandable reasons. But at least in Kingdoms I can feel like I'm accomplishing things and gaining headway, even if it does take me days at a time to make said headway.</p><p>The chat system in Mush is also of bad design. Not only is the nexus feed clunky, the fact that you get only 3 inventory slots and one of them must be the walkie talkie or you can't communicate is ridiculous. I can see maybe needing it if you leave the ship, like for patrol or an expedition, but is it really necessary on the ship? For that matter, is the ship map another item that really needs to be eating up one of your 2 remaining inventory slots? Those items just don't need to exist.</p><p>Actually, it just hit me, I see lots of people bring the walkie talkie on expeditions with them. I mean, if you have a way to communicate, how do people get lost during them? Seems to me these characters should be smart enough to use it to let their team members know they're lagging behind. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> (And I mean in context to the story and not actually needing to be done by the player specifically. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lookup.png" alt=":innocent:" class="tid_ico">)</p>

                <p>Having recently gotten into the mush beta myself, i tend to agree with alot of your points ghost.</p><p>It does feel like you spend most of your time staring at your character lying down, or if your unlucky and don't have a bed, twice as long staring at them standing up.</p><p>The chat system is horrible, though when you suggest alternatives to other players they cling to this "its against the rules" motto.</p><p>The casting / meta / grouping mechanic is a contrived pay wall barrier, designed to suck as much money out of those that like organised play as possible. Then strips these players of distinctions, titles and ranking.</p><p>Which is a pretty huge slap in the face to a paying customer that wants, team work.</p><p>Those that want to achieve the ultimate objective of eden, have to basically luck out and get a crew of mostly gold subscription holders, all who have upgraded heroes, who are all active, and all know how to play their class to the finest detail.</p><p>As for the walky talky, you don't need one if you favourite certain threads, or if you are the admin lady, or if you are standing on the bridge.</p><p>Regardless, i've begun to compile information together in the hopes of making a viable strat guide that i can share with the community, so that some new player can refer to it, and not be 100% useless, when they are on board with me.</p><p>It has a higher learning curve than die2nite.

                <p>Wow... so you haven't even finished your first voyage and you're already professional mush player that knows everything about the game, huh?</p><p>Eden does not require anyone with Gold... it simply requires luck in finding planets that give star maps and a crew that mostly works together to go on expeditions and do the appropriate research.</p><p>As far as the castings, no one really knows how those work yet and what number of tickets you get from what method nor do we know how many it takes from each person to participate. Much like everything else with beta, we all started with some obscene number of tickets available to us. Sure the people that pay for the game will (and should) get some extra number of tickets, but I've received a few just from my ships lasting 10 days or longer. That's not all that difficult to do if you have a decent crew and you get the tickets as long as the ship survives, whether you do or not.</p><p>But why let facts color your uninformed opinions?</p>

The general lack of common sense, complete knowledge phobia, lack of commitment, general inactiveness, have long been cancers of this game genre.</p><p>The reason it annoys me personally, is because if i pay money toward a certain experience, why should i be forced to team with free to play inactives, griefers, or players without the character skill sets to achieve the ultimate victory.</p><p>Perhaps if there was a optional seperate class of ship for gold modes only to join, i would be more impressed with mush's structure.</p><p>But as it stands now, If i invest in gold mode and join a random ship, theres a good chance that it will be infected with inactives, griefers etc. That to me is a waste of my time and money.</p><p>As for my comments above.</p><p>Professional Mush player? No.</p><p>My own opinion. Yes?</p><p>However after pouring over the wiki and reading through the various question and answer threads of the beta, its not hard to see, and formulate a pattern for success.</p><p>I'm sure if and when my guide comes out, you will be my greatest critic.</p><p>Its a game of math after all, a game of efficency in an enviroment that promotes chaos. Just like die2nite, and just like die2nite, there are procedures that can be put in place to order that chaos.</p><p>Is it so wrong to share those ideas, however nubile, with the world?</p><p>As for the ticket thing, the french wiki seems to indicate it takes 53 tickets, just to get started. Then it follows on from there. Perhaps its wrong to assume that will be the standard rate for the english version.</p><p>But as far as i can tell, the french and english versions are carbon copies of one another.</p><p>As for eden being in reach of bronze players, i beg to differ on that.</p><p>The early math, suggests a considerable AP advantage for silver and gold players.</p><p>That advantage trickles down, and effects mush's gameplay at every level.</p><p>Its like comparing residents and heroes. And we haven't seen a resident town take victory in die2nite ever.</p><p>Till its proven otherwise... i stand by that "opinion" that its out of reach of free2players.</p><p>I always cringe alittle when i'm called into conflict, with unnamed members. As its always a meta ive had the greatest respect for. And for a time, trying to reverse engineer your methods and maps, was what kept me interested in die2nite, so much so that it bordered on obsession.</p><p>But that was a year ago, and now its time for a new game.</p><p>Who knows?

                <p><cite>For example. A bronze level Roland that never sleeps in a bed generates only 168 AP over a 20 day voyage.<br><br>In bed : A potential 320 AP.</cite></p><p>First, this math doesn't make sense to me. Sleeping in a bed gives 2 ap instead of the default 1. Your "in bed" number should be exactly double the former number.</p><p>Second, sleeping in a bed isn't a function of gold. Anyone can do it... you just need to snag a bed while there's one available to snag.</p><p>Yes, that means there's significantly more AP available to someone who gets a bed on a more routine basis, but it has nothing to do with paying to get more AP and nothing to do with any sort of advantage from paying.</p><p>However, I'm also a firm believer of people that have the "more difficult" jobs being allowed to sleep in a bed. If you're taking a ship out to kill hunters, that's a lot of AP every time you launch and absolutely you should be using a bed as much as you can. Need to chase mush around the ship looking for clues? Sleep. Need to run around the ship looking for things that are broken and need fixing? Sleep.</p><p><cite>The shooter skill added to his roster, is a potential 40 free attacks on hunters or crew.</cite></p><p>This is where I'll agree that it's absolutely a perk of paying to play the game. But I don't have a problem with it. Heroes in d2n get extra ruck space, extra items in their starting inventory, extra hero abilities, even blueprints when starting towns. Why is that fair, but not some free points that don't even amount to all that much in the grand scheme of things? Seriously, play those characters and you'll see for yourself. It's not game breaking if you don't have those skills and there aren't enough people on the ship *with* the skills to make it all that much of an advantage. Especially when you add in the fact that you never know who's mush and working on what or inactive or not paying attention to what the ship wants and only doing whatever gets them the most glory...</p><p><cite>I believe the quest for Eden is a very AP intensive undertaking, that may just be out of reach for those without the skillset to tackle it.</cite></p><p>It's no more AP intensive than doing expeditions for fuel, or oxygen or rations. It's simply a matter of luck to find the right zones then get the right outcome.</p><p>To get to eden, you need to find pieces of star map. They're most commonly found in Cristalite zones and occasionally from Intelligent Life.</p><p>When you find the first piece, you need to do some research on the ship to build the calculator. Then once you have three pieces, you put them in Nexus and use the calculator to find Eden.</p><p>Sure, there's AP required to do the research and presumably some small amount to calculate the location (maybe someone who's played the French version can confirm... no one's found the third piece in our beta yet), but it's not out of reach for any active crew that's even somewhat working together.</p>

You're on your very first ship, likely with others that aren't quite sure what they're doing.</p><p>You really need to play more than one character and more than one ship to really decide anything more than "do I like it".</p><p>Though one thing to keep in mind... Eden is hard to reach for anyone. It's intentionally like that. It's totally RNG/luck dependent and even with some of the incredibly long lasting ships that have happened in beta, none of them have pulled off an Eden end yet. And that's with everyone/almost everyone being gold level characters.</p>
