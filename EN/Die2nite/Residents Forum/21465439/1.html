                <p><strong>Day 1 in Nasty facilities of the hunted </strong></p><p><em>0637 &lt;16hrs until attack</em></p><p>The Portal Lock was built before I even got into town, but we also had the Watchtower. Not too bad so early in the game. It’s better than not having any builders at all.</p><p>Had one guy use all their AP up trying to fight a zombie to escape. It’s too bad, because he posted in the forum AND put himself on Escort Mode, but klak couldn’t move them because they were out of AP and were already refreshed and fed.</p><p>We have posted many threads containing information about Escort Mode, Dusk til Dawn, zombie killing and other general knowledge.</p><p>Clint and Jitter both posted in the Resident’s Forum. It’s good to have people actively helping to give us more points.</p><p>Have a lot of the map explored already. Our town is off-centre, up in the north-west corner. We’ve discovered 6 buildings but only 3 aren’t buried; the Destroyed Pharmacy, a Fast Food Restaurant, and the PI-KEYA Furniture place. I looked around one of the buried buildings and found evidence that it’s probably a Family Tomb. I didn’t hang around. There were 7 zombies there already and I wasn’t waiting to see if the Family in the tomb wanted to come out for lunch.</p><p>No Explorable Ruin yet.</p><p>The entire northwest quadrant is almost completely void of zombies. It’s been fully explored (thanks to yours truly) and only has what looks to be the buried Family Tomb. Still, those 4 occupied zones will become a threat if we don’t clear them out a.s.a.p.</p><p>There’s still 16hrs until the attack and 19 people are outside! I just hope we can keep it up!</p><p>I requested in the forums that everyone staying inside tomorrow put their water rations in the bank. We have a few water pistols and too many zombies close to town. While I would prefer to keep the water for emergencies, those zombies will have us surrounded in a few days if we don’t take care of them now. I just hope my request doesn’t fall on deaf ears.</p><br><p><em>2240 &lt;1hr before attack</em></p><p>Still don’t have a gatekeeper.</p><p>Will have a death by addiction tonight by the looks of it.</p><p>This town is probably full of the newest of the new. So far we have the Watchtower, Portal Lock and Reinforced Gates built, despite having had ‘Workshop’ as the recommendation since the start of the day.</p><p>It looks like we will be building things from the lowest resource cost up, meaning we won’t last very long.</p><p>We have 6 people on Watchman duty, even though people have been told to not go on there unless needed. It’s even fully explained in the forums about the risk of death being 5% at the minimum when defence is greater than the attack as a Watchman as opposed to being 0% when defence is greater than attack and you’re in town with the gates shut.</p><p>One guy is even giving us <strong>NEGATIVE</strong> 5 defence points... <em>facepalm</em></p><p>I’ll eat my camouflage cape if we make it to day 5, though they are learning, -ish, so maybe we can still save them.</p><p>I sensed another building on my way back to town, so I’ll be checking that out tomorrow.</p><p>Still no Explorable Ruin.</p><p>13 people outside. 7 have no chance if they camp where they are. 4 have a very small chance as they are at buildings. 2 of these 4 have an even lower chance as they are closer to the town and only residents.</p><p>The remaining 2 are our Survivalist, klak, camping at the Fast Food Restaurant who, to my knowledge, has a pretty good track record of mass camping trips and living long enough to make it back to town, so their survival looks good. The other is the Scout, Maxmansung, who is camping (by the look of it) a Dilapidated Building in the furthest corner of the map with 10 zombies.</p><p>Of course, I wish everyone out there the best, but have already begun making preparations for the mourning ceremony tomorrow.</p><p>Looks like I’ll be taking drugs to close the gates. This isn’t good as there are currently no projects at the Construction site in progress and I’m not going to start work on the Emergency Supplies. I believe the only reason we haven’t started building them yet is that people are out of energy.</p><p>So I’ll be spending left over AP upgrading to a Tent and then maybe building an improvement.</p><p>We’ll see.</p><p>At a glance, the activity level of everyone isn’t so bad. Only 5/40 have one star. It’s just too bad that most act on their own and aren’t active in the forums.</p><p>Big thanks to Reitgerte, who closed the gates 5mins before the attack!</p><p>11 people locked outside. Looks like we’re losing our Scavenger. Nothing more to do today then hide under my bed and scream into my rucksack.</p><p><strong>Lessons of the day:</strong></p><p>People can come through, even if you’re expecting the worse.</p><p>Beginners can never resist the wonders of red buttons.</p>

                <p><strong>Day 2</strong></p><p>Out of the 11 people who stayed outside, 6 didn’t make it. Which is pretty good, all things considered.</p><p>We now have the BPs for the Fast Food Restaurant and the Destroyed Pharmacy. Surprisingly, both residents who camped at the Pharmacy survived, even though it was the closer one to town.</p><p>I checked the results from the Kitchen and Lab raffle we had yesterday and it looks like Detour will be out Chef and a player from my coalition, matty5665. I hope that they live long enough to put these improvements to good use, and I hope that that the majority of this town has at least some idea of what ‘good use’ means.</p><p>I built a Flash Bomb and am getting ready to head out for the day, nice and early. I mean really, who needs sleep now-days? I’m waiting for someone else to open the gates though. A Scout needs every point she can get, after all. So maybe a quick nap won’t hurt...</p><p>As I made my way over to my camp bed, I decided to check up on the other citizens.</p><p>Unfortunately, haloguy has been seriously wounded and is coughing up blood. Looks like they got bit. Eminemrecords is not only seriously wounded and infected, but on the verge of dehydration. I’m just hoping they die of infection, don’t want to lose any points!</p><p>Thankfully, these are the only 2 signs of infection, injury or thirst. A new day is upon us!</p><p>I got a Community Extremist complaint. If these noobs think that I’m an Extremist for letting them know the basics of the game in the nicest way possible, then they don’t need to worry about the zombies any more, the players in harder towns will be the ones to eat them alive.</p><p>I am made to be a Scout. Finished exploring the entire top half of the map today (which is the smaller half, but eh, still an accomplishment). Was massively disappointed that I didn’t find any of the Architect’s Chest... but tomorrow is another day.</p><p>Excellent news! klak2nite, our survivalist, found the Explorable Ruin! It’s an Abandoned Bunker. Has a bit of a zed problem in and around it, but what doesn’t? Looking forward to maybe checking it out, though running out of air has been my downfall in the past 2 Small Map towns, so maybe I’ll just stick to exploring XD</p><p>Got the Workshop up (finally). Have 4 FPF’s to convert and fingers crossed for the Jarpen table so we can find out who’s been building the smaller-resource buildings and PM the crap out of them (don’t want to lose any points through shunning, do we) Yes, yes, I am a point scab.</p><p>I feel proud of myself for creating a spreadsheet to help keep track of the score. Also have one that monitors Activity to help decide who gets the Hero days should we win. I won’t be accepting them, no matter how much everyone else thinks I deserve them. I kid, but I have over 100 days left, so I think that will last me until the next sale.</p><p>All that exploring wore me out, and although I got back to town early, with 1AP saved for the gates, I slept through the attack... better than last night though. Screaming and crying under my bed wasn’t pleasant. Perhaps it was the lack of sleep last night that made me so tired that I didn’t wake up at every little noise? Such as the noises of the other citizens trying to find someone strong enough to open the gates. Reitgerte (whose name I can now spell off-by-heart) got the gates again tonight, thank Google.</p><p>All in all, a good day, though we did find out that eminemrecords is also addicted, on top of everything else, so I believe they will definitely die2nite. There was a commotion in the forums about them hoarding items as well. They said they kept running out of AP, to which my coa did a collective facepalm. But, these are the learning towns. When I was a noob, fresh into the World Beyond and still remembered what hope, love and a warm shower felt like, I used to flash scavenge. So we all learn along the way.</p><p>Lessons for the day:</p><p>Sleep is good.</p><p>I is best Scout.</p><p>Explored maps make me feel really good, for some sad reason XD Though this links to every game ever with explorable maps, so I think is just my thing <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p><strong>Day 3</strong><br>We lost 6 people in the World Beyond last night, including our Scavenger. This sucks, seeing as we found our ruin yesterday and could’ve used their extra oxygen. Good news? So far we have lost no one to anything other than the World Beyond. Though tonight is the moment of revelation. All inactives will die2nite of dehydration, which will affect our overall score (which is currently 860).</p><p>Got on really late. Decided now would be a good time to stop sleep under the stars and built myself a tent. It’s not much, but at least I can write in this journal now without <em>some</em> citizens reading over my shoulder. They know who they are.</p><p>The Watchtower has upgraded to the point where I need to rely on my pocket watch’s hacked abilities. For those unaware, every citizen has a pocket watch, but it does more than just let you know how many hours you have left until the horde descends upon the town. It allows us to communicate in what we call ‘forums’, and allows other citizens to see our ‘avatar’ (normally a picture cut from an old magazine), name, where we are in the world beyond, and our job (if we are good enough to have gotten one yet). It also gives you a basic map of the World Beyond, one that is constantly flickering with morbid messages.</p><p>However, the more tech savvy citizens have managed to hack this device and have created a much more detailed mapping system, suitably called Dusk til Dawn. This is a global system, meaning any change one citizen makes to the map can be seen by all citizens. Not many people in the facilities know how to use it yet (even though I hold a brilliant lecture in the forums everyday).</p><p>Anyway, I must now use DTD’s advanced abilities to shade in the areas not yet explored. You really can see just how useful this app is here, as in my search for the Architect’s Chests I must go through as many unexplored zones as I can. This app allows me to plan my path, and not be misled by our Watchtower.</p><p>Today is defence focused. We will try and get the Wall Upgrade built and, should all go well, the first layer of Armour Plating. Construction has been slow though, with hardly anyone building. This is mainly because we lack the resources, even though much of the town goes out to scavenge. We are getting it together. I only hope we can do it faster than the zombies can multiply.</p><p>As normal, I did my rounds through the citizen’s houses, chatting with a few and hearing some rumours about others.</p><p>Bomb3rman as 2 complaints for selfish play. The price people are willing to pay for nice things. Though the lamp really does match his sleeping bag.</p><p>We have a few flash scavengers, according to the logs, but seeing as this has never been brought up I posted a neutral thread explaining what it is and why it isn’t encouraged. Hopefully it gets through.</p><p>Looks like we’ll be losing quite a few people tonight.</p><p>It’s creepy, you know? Watching these people just lie on their camp beds, slowly dying of thirst. Why not just walk to the well and get some water? It’s like they’ve just given up before even trying. I’d like to say I want to help them, but why help someone who won’t even help themselves?</p><p>Two more infected. I don’t know the details of their infections, just that it’s too late to help them. kingskittles is even asking around for meds, but the more experienced players know that this is just temporary. Without bandages for the wounded, they’ll just be infected again tomorrow.</p><p>I estimate at least 9 people will die tonight and so once again I plan for the mourning ceremony.</p><p>I found out that klak2nite has found one Architect’s Chest and the sealed one. After I had explored ¾ corners of the map, it looks like they are all in that last corner.</p><p>I won’t be going back to town tonight, I’ve made plans to camp at the PI-KEYA. There’s no BP left, but I can’t make it back to town, so I’ll just upgrade the zone and hope for the best.</p><p>It looks like klak2nite and kingskittles are out here too. I hope they live the night, though I could hear skittles moans of pain as I passed the zone he was in...</p><p>Reitgerte has saved some energy to close the gate. So all is looking well.</p><p>The only thing I saw worth mentioning is that we got the Wall Upgrade done. Sadly, someone also saw fit to build the Small Cafe, and info from the forums says that the Great Pit is being built as well.</p><p>Only tomorrow will tell how this town proceeds.</p><p>Lessons:<br>Low use of resources = high chance of getting built.<br>People would rather die than walk.</p>

                <p><strong>Day 4</strong></p><p>So after sleeping on a bed I constructed out of pieces from a work desk, table and shoe holder, I read the Gazette and my heart stopped.</p><p>18 people died last night. The gates were left open.</p><p>I...I had heard it, you know? I shoved my watch under a bunch of stuff to block out the noise, I had only heard the static. The screaming must’ve come later.</p><p>Clint and Jitter, the first 2 to help our town get points in the World Forums, are dead. Eaten alive. I wish I could’ve changed their fate. I wish so many things now that it’s so close to the end.</p><p>Klak didn’t make it either, so the rare BPs they were carrying and the sealed chest are just lying out in the World Beyond. Lying out of reach with the rotting, gnawed corpse of a member of my own coalition. I wonder how matty is taking it? How am I taking it? I just feel so numb.</p><p>I’ll decide later. Right now, I just need to get back to town. Try and hold this together. People will be panicking. I don’t blame them. 11 people against the horde seems crazy, but we can last a couple more days. We have to try.</p><p>***<br><br>Got back to town and decided to make a break to where klak was last seen. <br><br>I know that the BPs will do nothing for us now, but staying in town will do less.<br><br>I started off with food, water, drugs and alcohol. <br><br>Originally, I had counted that I would have enough AP to make it to the zone and back with no AP to spare. On my way south I encountered a zone with 4 zombies in it. Thinking nothing of it, I continued for 2 more zones before realising that if I didn’t kill 2 of those 4 zombies, the citizens would be stuck in a surrounded town. So I back tracked, well aware that I could no longer make it back to town, but hoping that I at least gave those left a fighting chance.<br><br>I plan to camp at the Dilapidated Building. I’ll have enough energy left to upgrade it decently enough.<br><br>When passing through the zone that klak died in, I found the BPs plus a bunch of weapons. I decided to drop everything I was carrying there (closer to the town) and only take the few weapons I might need to kill any spread that I can’t handle.<br><br>So clinging to a Hurling Stick and a water pistol with 2 shots left, I found a tomb and bunkered down, another night in the World Beyond.<br><br>This time, I muffled my pocket watch well before the attack.</p>

                <p><strong>Day 5</strong></p><p>It isn’t a relief to wake up any more. Not when there are so little people left. Though the town gates were closed last night, almost 200 zombies got through. Now there are only 4 of us left.</p><p>I’d like to take this time to mention two people who will now weigh heavy on my conscience; Reitgerte, the bright-eyed and bushy tailed youth. The reliable gatekeeper. Though they were new to this way of life, they took it head on. Always willing to learn, and grateful for the knowledge. I look into their soul and see great potential. No doubt over time we will see great things come from Reitgerte, and one day they might really have control over the sands in the World Beyond (they know what I mean).</p><p>The second is my other coalition member, matty5665. This must be what survivor’s guilt feels like. First klak, lost in the World Beyond, and now matty, eaten alive in town. I am the last one left. And although we had only just met, this whole thing would not have been possible if not for my coa siblings. The town was better for having them in it.</p><p>Reitgerte and matty, both names I will remember as I continue this meaningless struggle until I too fall prey to the merciless World Beyond. And while I didn’t know much about them, nor them about me, I do know this; that the world is now darker, and colder and, for the first time, I truly feel alone.</p><p>Yet, I continue.</p><p>I am searching the area around the Dilapidated Building.</p><p>On my way out I found a Mobile Phone. People used to use them to communicate with each other, before... I now use it to talk to someone. Someone on the other side of the World. Someone afraid and alone and surrounded by the reanimated bodies of former friends and allies. Someone so much like myself. Someone... Anyone...</p><p>I’ve decided to spend the night in an ordinary zone. No contact with those left in town, I can only rely on the Gazette and Dusk til Dawn to tell me what’s going on.</p><p>Installed a solid wooden board in the zone I’ll be sleeping in, killed off all the zombies. I don’t know why I even bothered.</p><p>I have used all of my Heroic actions, using my last one yesterday to find some water. It’s now only a matter of time.</p>

                <p><strong>Day 6</strong></p><p>Complete silence.</p><p>I am now the last human left in the World. It’s such a terrifying feeling.</p><p>Maybe I’ll die tonight, maybe I’ll die tomorrow, but I now know that no one will mourn for me. No tears will be shed, nor words spoken.</p><p>I... I’ve been thinking about ending it, you know? But I can’t find anything sufficient, and even if I did, everyday I’m alive counts. Sooner isn’t better in this situation.</p><p>I’m finding myself thinking a lot. Re-reading conversations in the Forums, conversations that seemed so important at the time. Would I have worded things differently had I known it would come to this?</p><p>The World Beyond is beautiful when you take the time to look. Before, all my eyes could see was items and zombies, but now, I can see this endless desert for what it is.</p><p>The end and the beginning. When I am gone, it will remain, and, over time, I will become part of it. My body will turn to dust and, finally, humankind will be one with nature once again.</p><p>Will we rise from the ashes, as our ancestors rose from the primordial ooze? Will something greater than use be born from our remains? Will they find our buildings, our notes, our journals and wonder about us?</p><p>If so, then I can accept this fate. Just as I carry the memory of 39 good men and women to my grave, so will my grave carry the memory of humankind. A race whose grandeur was as mighty as its shortcomings. A race whose kindness was as boundless as its cruelty. A race who loved, hated, killed and cared for itself above all else.</p><p>A race that is almost over.</p><p>Soon I’ll be able to go home.</p><p>I have realised that there is only one thing left to achieve in this lifetime – I <em>must</em> open this Sealed Architect’s Chest!</p><p>Although I can feel it slowly draining my energy with each try, I continue. This is all that is left!</p><p><em>1... 2... 3...</em> Damn it! Why won’t it open!</p><p><em>4... 5...</em> YES! Success!</p><p>I hold a very rare blueprint in my now shaking hands. It brings tears to my eyes. Crying, I clasp it to my chest.</p><p><em>I did it klak</em> I think to myself, and although I will never know what the blueprints were for, just knowing that we managed to get them was more than enough.</p><p>I stand and look out into the World Beyond. I will head for the most distant corner and let myself be swallowed by whatever lies beyond the Beyond.</p><p>The meaty bone I ate has infected me, and I carry with me a dirty bottle of Vodka Marinostov and some unlabelled drugs. I find myself in a much better mood as I head into the hordes. Drugs, alcohol, a very rare. Body burning with infection.</p><p>I put the pills in my mouth and swallow them with a swig of Vodka. I adjust my camouflage vest and wipe some of the dirt off it. The remaining pills, the vodka bottle and the blueprint all fit nicely into my manbag. Calmly, I fit the water pistol under my belt and the water bomb into my pocket. I ready the hurling stick in one hand and raise my torch with the other and venture out on my last expedition.</p><p>The vodka is gone. So are the pills.</p><p>Drunk, infected, hooked. What better way to go?</p><p>I killed all the zombies in this zone. Three from the water bomb, two with the pistol and the last with the hurling stick, which lasted the assault.</p><p>There are a few hideouts in this zone, but survival chances are still hee haw to me.</p><p>I won't bother to put my vest back on. I don't want to hide anymore.</p><p>I'm glad I got to choose my fate, unlike the citizens before me.</p><p>It's not suicide, just acceptance of the inevitable.</p><p>I can hear them outside already.</p><p>The torch burns low, it's so beautiful. Though that could be the drugs.</p><p>I can see them outside!</p><p>Reitgerte! klak! matty! Devonus! Clint! Jitters!</p><p>Everyone... Everyone's here! I'm so happy!</p><p>It's good to see you again.</p><br><p><em>dramatic burning out of torch</em></p>
