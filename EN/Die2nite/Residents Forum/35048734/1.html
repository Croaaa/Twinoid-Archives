                <p>This thread is started so we can discuss and are able to choose the 3 teams representing Die2Nite in the battle of the servers, called Ultimate Fighting Championship.</p><br><p>I`m far from telling anyone how we will do the recruiting, in my opinion the community majority should decide.</p><p>The signing form of Spreadsheet was prepared, so everyone interested can put their name at least and we`re going to go from there when the decision is made.</p><br><p>However if we want to have good chances to win, at least one of the towns` all members could be chosen by respected leader or team of leaders (team of leaders, if we decide we`d prefer to avoid having full metas playing in this competition, which could happen if only 1 person is picking their players).</p><p>If we decide to give a chance to this idea, another voting would be made to pick the leader/leaders and they would be given the right to pick set number of players from the interest spreadsheet - depending of number of leaders) for their town.</p><p>I wouldn`t like this idea to sound elitist, I don`t like to exclude anyone from the event, nor from the town - in theory - having best chances. It`s simply my best thought of what could give Die2Nite the best possible chance to win with other servers in Servers Championships.</p><p>I know french players aren`t doing recruiting this way, but the result will be similar to:<br>1 main town with most experienced in leading and organising events/towns players only<br>2 other towns with players interested in joining as much, but not qualified to the main town according to their requirements.<br>The competition will be tough surely and as far as I`d like to see no elitism, especially in such big competition, I`m sure that <em>3 towns, all having random set of signed players, won`t be able to achieve as much as carefully chosen team.</em></p><p>After all 3 towns rosters are chosen with some backups, I will send all the names to Epoq, so all the quallified players may receive their pass codes allowing to join the private towns on May 5th. One last person per each town will be chosen to join at the decided time of May 6th to open the gates and start the event - those players will be chosen from the towns` rosters, depending of their real life time zone and availability.</p><br><p>If this idea is accepted, I`d like to suggest that <span class="tid_user tid_user_1719300 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1719300">fodgycakes</span> alone (as long as she is interested) has free pick of <strong>all 39</strong> town members for one of the towns so it has the best chances to beat all other towns. Fodgycakes has the best record of top towns in our server and if only one player is chosen, in my opinion it should be her. She is known for her endless patience and the ability to encourage all other people around, constantly and carefully looking for all available options to make each of her towns the best in history.</p><p>The other 2 towns can be assembled from the rest signed players chosen in same or any other matter - one or more leaders could agree to participate in the pick for another town(s). As much as I`d like to give everyone a chances to participate, at the same time I`d like to avoid having to raffle the participants in any of the 3 towns.<br>Even if it may sound as the most fair way of picking, the event is most likely one and only competition of this kind we are going to see, so we have one chance for the win only and need to treat it seriously.</p><br><p>Still I`d like to emphasize again that the decision is not mine, it is ours.<br>Please sign up if interested and lets have the most fun out of it while trying to win.</p><p>Thank you for the attention and good luck.</p>

                <p>I think staminah is dead on with this one. The best chances of winning the competition are for teams of people that are known to get along and <strong>do well</strong> together to play for the glory.</p><p>Fodgy will do an *awesome* job of pulling the right people together to make a successful town. That much is obvious.</p><p>And while RFM and unnamed can work well together and get along just fine, it's no secret that they're just as capable of taking the top spot...</p><p>If the decision is to have just one organized meta town, it's very likely to be a combination of RFM and unnamed... but I think for the best chances of actually winning the competition, I think we need to throw our two best groups at it in their entirety.</p>

Then you can add in some great singular players as "fillers", but the core should be made of highly experienced players that played together many times and ranked first on the leaderboards.<br>The downside is that it might be difficult to form the 3rd team and 40 spots might be tight to fit in the remaining players. Also, some good players might feel immediately excluded from the best teams.<br>Whatever is the result, I'm happy to see this happen. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":sq_smile:" class="tid_ico"></p>

I'd compare it to saying that countries shouldn't send their best athletes who have won all the qualifying competitions to the Olympics because, well that would be elitist.

However, I know how our show runs and in general what I need to do on a given day. I know my teammates have got that too. This comes from literally years of playing together. The camaraderie we have is not to be discounted in how well we do - I'll go the extra mile for my team and stay up past the point of reasonable to get a zombie run done in a serious town, etc. These people are my D2N family. RFM has got a similar dynamic going, I'm sure.</p><p>Yes, our leaders could surely whip together a great town from random willing players.

                <p>Theres nothing wrong with being Elitist about 1 of the 3 towns, as far as im concerned I want die2nite to beat the other servers into the ground. What IS wrong is when a team that consistenetly come second place automatically assume they have a God given right to a whole other town, when theres only 3 to begin with (and i say this with absolutely no disrespect to those players meant).</p><p>In that respect a regularly ranking 3rd META would have the right to come along and say "its our God given right to have the third town" and nobody would agree that that would be fair, would they?</p><p>The last town to be filled with 2/3 players from all the other METAs that enjoy the game would be an absolute hodgepodge and would surely fail leaving us 1/3rd less chance to beat the other teams. Why limit ourselves that way?</p><p>My thought would be to give fodgycakes' team the town they rightly deserve to try and win die2nite the competition and the other 80 slots go to 10 players from all the other METAs out there. Are there even 8 top METAs here? 10 representatives from each META across 2 towns, cant say fairer than that IMO</p>

                <p>To return to a tangent by Rain, in case of Olympic sports, they do tend to take the cream of the crop rather than specific teams, in events, I think? Anyway, this discussion has lead me to conclude that this is kind of a shitty event if it was meant to involve the server, rather than just a few meta groups. Thus I'm bored. Have fun working it out. To be honest, this probably belongs more on the Saloon server, because the way everyone's talking about it, the server is going to be entirely represented by Heroes who are in metas (which while definitely a stronger representation of the server, is by no means accurate in representing the server's nature [of course, then we'd have to have a tenth of the town preparing for LMS by day 3] or its character [because to be honest, a very fairly decent amount of meta players do not frequent the world forums {yes, it's way more than average, but still}]). Anyone up for the third town being completely made up of people who are actually interested enough to post on the relevant thread in a complete sentence that they want to join this event? To actually represent the forum-going population?</p>

We want to avoid any conflict at all costs. Ideally, what would be good is a few "leaders" who know each other well, and the rest should be people who share the same views with the leaders, and are willing to be followers. Perhaps even chosen by those leaders like how <span class="tid_user tid_user_1719300 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1719300">fodgycakes</span> was proposed to do. <br>If you have 1 person that's a natural leader, but isn't open to others suggestions, it will be a catastrophe. If you have 2 natural leaders that don't know each other, it will be a catastrophe too. <br>I'm starting to wonder whether the last town should be a full meta too. à_à</p><p>If we decide the last town is going to be a mix, there probably should be a test town for it to see how people get along.</p><p>Not sure if there's time for this, but an alternative could be that people who want to be in the 3rd town have to group up and form teams of 40 and do a qualifying competition. The town that does the best fills the 3rd town. This could potentially be dangerous too, but isn't everything? In the end, the RNG is almighty.</p>

This is a few months away! Contact someone who is a leader or a knowledgeable player and tell them you are active and want to learn competitive playstyle and techniques!

He looked at hordes and saw that their top town has 1114 points which is nothing compared to our top town that has 1491 points. However on hordes they don't have souls (you know those little fire things that float around on the map when someone dies and if you cash them in you get 10 town points). So that's 390 points that you can't get while on the hordes server. So when comparing the scores of D2N verses Hordes you need to subtract those points before you compare those scores. So the 1114 verse 1491 is actually 1114 verses 1111.</p>

                <p>it seems they have a committee of 6 of their top players picking their teams so i reckon theyre going for 2 strong towns with 3 of those in each as leaders and one other town made up from what appears to be a very democratic discussion about newer and more experienced players.</p><p>I must say their WF has me jelly-belly with the amount of activity they have going on over there, but their external Apps are poo.</p>

                <p>Unnamed usually have some residents, it's no big deal, we usually BIA them for scout duty and stuff as needed. Most of the time we have loads of people just digging up logs anyway. If there's a choice between playerA as a resident and playerA as a full-time hero, obviously the full-time hero would be preferred. But playerA as resident vs playerB hero? Depends on the player.</p>

Have the devs agreed to create towns on each server that have the same mechanics? Or are we jumping on to each other's servers? If it's the former, great. If not, it would bring a whole new problem to the event. Even if some people were willing to be a hero on all servers, you can't even BIA unless you have 25 days under your belt. I doubt many from here have that, and even fewer have second wind, pro camper etc.</p>

                <p>That made me smile. To clarify, I am indeed German so they might be talking about me (my French is school level, only). Also, I am not that popular at Hordes, my Oval Office was dissed a lot but it didn't have all the functions from DV or D2N. But I'll take a look at their forums and see if I can clarify something there as well.</p>

                <p>I finally had time to read this thread. Thank you so much iDare for the time you have taken to organize the d2n server participation in this event which looks to be very exciting and should be a very close competition!</p><p>I very much appreciate the thought you have put into how our server wants to go about taking part and how sensitive you are to the contrasting perspectives of what you feel would be the most competitive option for picking teams versus making it a more all-inclusive event.</p><p>I am in agreement with those who believe the best chance for a win is to field the three most competitive teams rather than the 120 "best" players. Thank you, iDare, for very kind words about why you think I should be chosen as the leader of one of these teams (or the one team if it was decided there would only be one). Though to clarify, while I am known as the leader of Unnamed, we have a group of town planners who would all be involved in a UFC town's roster selection and planning.</p><p>I do think that Unnamed shouldn't be the only meta to represent d2n as a whole/almost-whole team. While we have taken many leaderboard wins, RFM has consistently proven they are just as quality a team. I need to correct <span class="tid_user tid_user_1721761 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1721761">spacekadt</span> 's post saying the only season we did not have a #1 was due to the Epoqalypse.. it was a while ago! We did take HC #1 that season (season 4). Season six we did not have a #1 town, RFM simply had a better town that season. We were going to make a second attempt but then ran out of time.</p><p>I think in the past Unnamed has had just the slight edge on RFM in play quality but that is no longer the case. I think the two teams are now close enough that RNG plays an even larger role in determining which of the two come out on top in any particular contest. If our server wants to put forth Unnamed because we want to win, then we should be putting forth RFM as well. All the qualities iDare listed about my leadership I could say 100% for him too.</p><p>As for the third team, 6FO has quickly proven to play at a very high level but they are new enough that I cannot comment much more than I think they would do very well too.</p><p>I think Dream's thoughts on the Unnamed team being mainly Unnamed + some others is a good idea if we can work it out to not cause discord within the team. I think the teamwork and camaraderie within Unnamed is an important part of our success but we have guests every town that fit right into that camaraderie. If Unnamed will be a team representing the server, then we must be serious with our meta members about needing to play at the top of their game for this particular town as it will likely be a one time opportunity. For our season #1 town runs we have and do work around people being on vacation or being busy and having limited time to carry out town plans. For this competition I think we need to consider that in order to put the server first, if any of the regular meta members will not be able to be as involved as they need to be, they should bow out just for this town.</p>

                <p>Voting is closed and option 4 has won indeed.<br>The community decided that Die2Nite server will be represented by 3 teams: Unnamed meta, Royal Flying Mowers meta and 6 Feet Over meta.</p><p>I`m sure that interested players from outside those teams have still good chance to get into the event by being invited by one of mentioned metas` leaders. Hardly any meta has permanent 40 members these days and even if it`s the case, most likely not everyone can be active enough to participate in each town.</p><p>I`ll be staying in touch with other team`s leaders and ask them to post final rosters of the towns (or I`ll post them myself) when the recruiting is done, so the community is aware what is going on.</p><p>There is also 15 backup players needed on the list we will send to Epoq on March 15th.</p>

My question is rhetorical, but I'm baffled how you managed to read that we think we "can lead a group of 40 to survive longer then [sic] any of the ufc teams" out of my and Philistine's posts. I cannot speak for Philistine (although I haven't noticed even a trace of that thought in his post), but I know I don't.<br>Do you really think we're posting out of such vanity? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":sq_sad:" class="tid_ico"> My point, and Philistine's as far as I understand, is that this could've been kept competitive without turning it into essentially a glorified meta jump for top 3-4 metas.<br>No to mention that your reply offers absolutely no arguments... Unlike Spacekadt post, with which I mostly don't agree but which offers a nice argument and evidence in favor. I'll get to why I don't agree with it in a moment, but a memorable passage comes to me (animals included purely due to association with the avatar, not any comment on anyone's intellect or behaviour): Ladies and gentlemen of the forum, exhibit number one is what the apes, the misinformed, simple, noble-haired apes, envied. Look at this tangle of thorns:<br><br><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_1721761 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1721761">spacekadt</span></span><cite><br>It takes a team that works well together. It takes a leader (or team of leaders) that's willing to put in the time and effort to make things happen. It takes quick thinking to fix derps (they ALWAYS happen).<br><br>Why can't a random town find this? Well, because you get ego clashes. You get the folks that don't want to listen. You get the folks that disagree and go off to do their own thing. You get impatient people who can't wait for someone to figure out an optimal ZK path and weapons.<br><br>You can see all of this with MMJ towns through the seasons. They often rank, and they're often good towns - but they're never at the top of the leaderboard (barring s3 when there were no 40 person metas) regardless of who's in the town.<br><br>It takes more than a leader and 39 random people. It takes camaraderie. It takes friendship. It takes those special people that are willing to pull all nighters to make plans come together. (oh yes, it has been done. many times.)</cite><br>It's a good argument, but problem is that the crux of evidence lies on assumption that MMJ is a good approximation of what proposed scenario (to flesh it out, although it's implicit in my post: 40 heroes randomly selected from UFC applications with possiby a few random leaders preselected) would've been. This is a big stretch of imagination, considering how many potential differences there are between two demographics and how many objective and quantifiable differences are:<br><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"> First off, different kinds of people apply to MMJ and UFC. UFC is an ultra-competitive competition, while MMJ is a community event, where you're not going to disappoint the (supposedly whole) server by dying early. So they attract different kinds of people.<br><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"> The goals of UFC town are known beforehand. This is a big difference since some people might come into MMJ with intent of scoring on some distinctions, some on building a wonder, some on ranking, etc. Some just get dragged in with their coalition and have no plans.<br><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"> The participants to one are drawn randomly from the pool of players essentially at the jump, at the other preferable and possible would be at least a month before jump. This enables incredible amount of planning to be done before the jump, as well as team building, compared to MMJ towns.<br><br>Further elaboration on each of these points is possible, but I don't think it's necessary. So I think MMJ is not a good enough approximation to draw any clonclusions... So the only evidence provided falls into the abyss.<br><br>What you said about getting 'folks who...' is a real danger, but it's not nearly a certainty, and I think the probability, with proper previous team building (e.g. a training town before the competition) and considering that the teams would be composed of dedicated heroes, would be essentially minimal. Sure, a meta which has been playing many season together would still have a lower chance, but I have never claimed that they would have a better chance than a meta, just that it <strong>isn't impossible</strong>. <br>I'd also wager that their chance are not significantly worse than top meta's. If they chance upon a Builder's Merchant BP and the others don't... But that's not my point here at all. I was just responding to a post which claimed it was flat out impossible for such a team to win this competition.<br><br>FWIW, neither of those two scenarios (the one voted for, nor the random selection of heroes) would've been my preferred one.</p>

I want to make sure they have as much bacon as their little hearts can handle before exploding. (And to you vegetarians out there: EAT THE BACON! EAT IT! IT MAKES YOU PLAY BETTER! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=":sq_clink:" class="tid_ico"> )</p><p>As far as random selection from the list - why should someone like daible (love you daible!) who plays with idare and is used to his leadership style and enjoys that crew be suddenly swapped to fodgy who she may not get along with just because that's what the RNG said? (note: afaik, daible gets along with fodgy just fine, this is just a hypothetical!) Why should idare or fodgy have to have someone on their team that is a newish player or doesn't really know the game or hell, just plain doesn't care but wants the glory just because that's what the RNG said? The RNG is a fickle bitch and should be avoided at all costs in terms of citizen selections if you want a cohesive team.</p><p><cite><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"> First off, different kinds of people apply to MMJ and UFC. UFC is an ultra-competitive competition, while MMJ is a community event, where you're not going to disappoint the (supposedly whole) server by dying early. So they attract different kinds of people.</cite></p><p>Not really. Have you seen the UFC signup list? Have you seen the people in MMJ? They're very, very similar lists. Very.</p><p>And I don't know about how you play MMJ, but most play it in a "meta style" which *is* competitive and *should* be played full tilt. There's really no excuse for griefing or dying early in an MMJ if you wouldn't do it in a meta town, imo.</p><br><p><cite><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"> The participants to one are drawn randomly from the pool of players essentially at the jump, at the other preferable and possible would be at least a month before jump. This enables incredible amount of planning to be done before the jump, as well as team building, compared to MMJ towns.</cite></p><p>When is this team building supposed to happen? Jump into towns instead of MMJ? I suppose, but then that's kindof a crap MMJ if a large number of good players are taken out of it.</p><p>In IRC? Some people aren't able to use IRC or just plain don't have time to sit around on a computer getting to know people for the sake of one town.</p><p>And then there's the whole point I made above about when the names were due. If I have joeschmoe123 assigned to my team and I come to realize he's a flaming asshole and I flat out refuse to play with him, what then? I've already submitted the final list to Epoq and he's going to get a town invite whether I like it or not.</p><p><cite>I'd also wager that their chance are not significantly worse than top meta's. If they chance upon a Builder's Merchant BP and the others don't... But that's not my point here at all. I was just responding to a post which claimed it was flat out impossible for such a team to win this competition.</cite></p><p>40 of the most awesome players ever will never win if they can't get along. Which is kinda my whole point summed up in a sentence. Since there's no time to determine whether people will get along well enough to play together, the way the towns are right now is quite simply the best option *for this event at this time*. Let me stress that again. <strong>For this event at this time.</strong></p><p>A different event may well call for a different strategy. A crazy long lead time may well call for a different strategy. Even just giving the teams more information may well call for a different strategy. (hah, who are we kidding?) But for this particular event, at this particular time, there's no way you can tell me that any setup other than the current one is optimal. Not "fair", not "fun for everyone"... optimal.</p><p>For better or worse, the part of the community that cared enough to vote, voted for this setup.</p>

I've just noted that MMJ experience cannot be extrapolated to all situations where there is semi-random selection of players, and specifically cannot be to this one.<br>The sole thing I was replying to was the assertion that there was no chance such a team could win, and then you took up my post which was referencing exclusively that specific assertion, and it turned into a more general thing, which I was never interested in discussing. I'll just respond to some things which are directly referencing my arguments:<br><cite>Not really. Have you seen the UFC signup list? Have you seen the people in MMJ? They're very, very similar lists. Very.</cite><br>I've seen them both. And I don't think that four 'very's are quite accurate. Most people in the UFC signup list do play in the MMJ, for obvious reasons, but the converse is not quite true. It's still true there is a large overlap, but the point is that MMJ towns are in a sense very 'diluted', with many players that I'm sure never even heard of UFC, so that's why I think that success/failures of one demographic cannot be extrapolated to other. <br>But I feel this topic is also one where only spinning in circles is possible, You think it's four very, I think it's only slightly.</p><p>Also, apparently our observatons of how people play MMJ are different, and I don't see much point discussing that either. Just looking at number of early deaths in each MMJ town is a bit depressing.<br><cite>For better or worse, the part of the community that cared enough to vote, voted for this setup.</cite><br>Well, I'm not trying to change anything here, but just as a food for thought you might be aware that there are many problems with first-past-the-post voting. In this case, where voting base was so low that one meta could have successfully voted alone for a winning option, I don't think that it can be said that 'community voted' for something, especially since the winning option got only 30% of total votes. I'm always inclined toward some kind of range/cardinal voting system, although I'm not sure if the results would've been any different in that case.</p>

                <p>Can't we all just get along?</p><p>Look, I feel bad that not everyone that wants too and probably deserve to be in the UFC this time around, but there is only 120 people that can, and a crap-load more that wanted to.</p><p>There will be future UFC events I am sure. Keep playing the game, making the contacts, and show how good you are and you will possibly be on board one of the next wave of teams.</p><p>Do I personally think I am better than anyone not chosen? No I don't, but what I have done is not only put in the time playing and managed to meet the right people at the right time and showed them my dedication and the skills i can bring to the table. And I dare say the same can be said for about everyone in my Meta and willing to bet the other two representative metas.</p><p>I agree with the point I'm pretty sure spacekadt was making (forgive me space if I'm wrong). Is that we are trying as a server to prove our style (the English server style) is superior to the other servers for bragging rights. And barring an "exhibition" town to check player compatability, we need to know we are throwing our 3 most cohesive teams at the competition because I am pretty sure they are bringing their "A" towns. Die2Nite is a cooperative game by design, and cooperation also requires trust. Of the 39 people I play with in the meta towns I trust 39 of them with my life (literally sometimes in game terms). It brings my game up to know I don't have to deal with drama or mis-communication. I cannot say the same for when I play a random town even one chock full of highly experienced players.</p><p>Its one thing to mix the pool up for things like the MMJ then you can get to know others and maybe form bonds, but the UFC is a competition and we should be bringing our three best TEAMS and not our 120 best heroes.</p><p>I just want to see our server win. I will be thrilled if its Unnamed but I will be happy if either 6FO or RFM won, so long as one of us three I will feel like a winner. Personally I'd love for us to take top 3! <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/cool.png" alt=":tid_cool:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>It's a jagged pill to swallow for some people, I know, but really our best chance is to put up proven teams, because we only get one shot at this particular UFC event. Hopefully I will get to play alongside some of you the next time a UFC event rolls around.</p>

Honestly, until this thread, I'd never even seen his name before.

According to some, that may be a good thing. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=":sq_clink:" class="tid_ico"> We have a few "new to us" players with us for UFC that all came by way of recommendation from known and trusted players that know how we play and would only give us suggestions for people that would fit well within that structure.

Think again. I have been on the outside of a selection process before, by my own meta, when we could only bring half the roster to the 20/20 collaboration with RFM a couple seasons back. My "attitude" was no different than it is now about the selection process. Back then of course I wished I was selected to participate, but I also knew there was finite spaces and they had to think of cohesion with the entire group so they chose who they did. I understood and sat on the sideline and root them on.</p><p>I apologize if I misread your statement, but the way it's worded it can easily be read with a sarcastic tone. Perhaps I'm wrong. I just wanted to clear the air on that particular point.</p>

                <p>Hey, I've already said I was a bad player on page 11. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":sq_happy:" class="tid_ico"> No need to analyse it in detail.</p><p>But all this talk about who deserves invite, who doesn't, is making me uncomfortable. I'm going to be honest, in effort for this to be my last post in this thread.</p><p>I wanted to play in UFC because it seemed really fun. Not because I wanted to defend honour of english-speaking server (as if that was a real thing), not because of some bragging right (to whom would I brag?), not because I wanted to do it for the community (the community largely doesn't care about UFC, except perhaps those playing in it), not because I had some notion that MT would benefit the english-speaking server in case of a win (oh yeah, some really believe that; I guess they haven't had the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI5hrcwU7Dk">lecture</a>). I'm not sure whether people really convinced themselves that english-speaking server winning is really an important thing, or they only believe it conveniently because it flatters them.</p><p>That is not to say I wouldn't have given my best to win, I would; just not because of some false sense of grandiosity that some folks seem to foster, but because it'd be fun.</p><p>Anyway, this is why I play this game -- to have fun. That's not to say I like building wonders and hate organization, au contraire, I find fun in the teamwork, in the group struggle to achieve something that individuals themselves couldn't, in the successes, and failures, and successes again, and, well, failures again.<br><br>So, I've thought about it and realised this event is not for me. Not just because I'm reluctant to pretend I have some patriotic feelings for english-speaking server, but because of the rampant judgement of players. I've looked it up, and there are people in the UFC roster who haven't signed up for the event at all, in the UFC backup list too. So someone who didn't care for the event enough to sign up got in, while those who signed up, which is a sign of a definitive interest, got left out, because someone judged them to not be good enough to replace those who, I repeat, didn't even care about the event enough to sign up.<br><br>If that isn't elitism, I don't know what is. And, as I've said, I realise I don't see myself in such company. I try not to judge players on grounds other than eagerness to help the town; and even that, perhaps the most basic of all judgements, is too fallible for me to attain any certainty of judgement.<br>I'm not trying to paint a picture of myself as better than those who judge, just as someone who obviously doesn't belong there. So I'd like to retreat from the UFC Backup list; of course, I have no illusions that I'd get into the event if I remained there, but I guess a symbolic gesture is as good as any.</p>

Many signed up only in one place. As it turns out, the vote went the way of 3 full metas, so the signups were done in-house anyway. iDare stated with the results of the poll that the original sheet was only to be used to fill any spare slots. If this is your idea of elitism, it's certainly an odd one.</p>

I do not see why one would feel proud because a team which happens to play on the same server wins.

Then it follows that those who would have most fun should participate.</p><p>I don't feel proud over achievements of my nation, of my region, of people related to to me, of my school, of my city, of any thing where I haven't directly and substantially contributed to something, and even then feeling proud is silly.

I didn't want to suggest I had any official diagnosis. Which is why I added the clause 'in the parlance of internet boards', where label of autism is somewhere thrown around without too much diagnostic rigor. For me however, although that'd be a convenient hyphothesis (insofar it would explain a lot of things while being inoffensive), unfortunately I think it's equally possible I'm just a self-centered jerk. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":sq_smile:" class="tid_ico"></cite><p>I am so glad I didn't hurt your feelings.

                <p>update- RFM banner is in beta stage so we gotta use that! Its 80x80 pixels. I hope that works. <br>sorry I know i get really excited over all ideas!!! <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_lol.gif" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I still think we should have a contest for something for us like perhaps an image that inserts under the Die2Nite name ( cause there will be a like category right? Or maybe could we customize the lettering for the Die2nite heading ( is there one? now I wonder? ) and like think the google search engine logo style, how many cool artistic things we could do for that too.</p>

On a 1280px wide screen this will leave about 85px max for each column and thus only images up to 85px can be shown in original size.<br>If that's not sufficient, you could also submit an 80px wide thumb and a larger version of the banner (opening on click on thumb), but then this will not really be present.</p><p>So, the answer to your question is: there is no defined size, yet. Since D2N is (probably) the first to submit any banner image, you will set the standard.</p><p>Alternatively, the banners could also be shown along with the town maps, then you would have more space but at a less prominent place.</p>

                <p>OK so let me explain in simple English.</p><p>I did not imply that it would be unfair because we would be the only ones to have it.</p><p>If night penalty is on (and I mean, on for everyone), it is unfair to the English server because we have players from all around the world. What is night time in Europe (and I believe that the vast majority of players on the French and German servers are in Europe, and in the same pocket of Europe as well) is just about any time of the day or night for us players of the English server.</p><p>For many of us, what is night time for you is actually the moment of the day when we can play. As such, we would be more affected by the night penalty, since it's not simply "night time" for us, when we are less active anyway.</p>

                <p>Yes. It's on for UFC in all towns. It's making me very very unhappy.</p><p>I doubt it's on for the server at large though. The easiest way for someone to tell is to look at the bank after 19:00 and before 07:00. If there's an option to steal from the bank, the night penalty is on.</p><p>And wtf good is stealing from the bank anyway?

                <p>Now that the competition is over since couple days, I`d like to say couple words in public, aside from sending a private letter with more direct thoughts to all members of my town - Flying Inn of MowFoes.</p><br><p><em>Knights</em><br>You did an awesome job retrieving the biggest amount of very rare blueprints I`ve ever heard of in one town, great effort. I know we were all hoping to find Builders Merchant which is so much luck-involved, but with your number of v.rares it was certainly expected to find it. Shame that both our towns ended up going with wrong end-game strategy, causing us dropping out of the race for the win and in the end even outside of top 3. Until this one decision your town was the most impressive of the 3 d2n towns I must say, congratulations.</p><br><p><em>Nameless</em><br>Thanks so much and at the same time big congratulations for claiming the win and bringing the cup to our server. I think your participation in an event can be always considered as some sort of safety deposit - if everything else fails, you will still come and save the day, which you`ve proven once again.</p><p>____________________________</p><br><p><em>MowFoes</em><br>Thank all of you for accepting the invitation around 1.5 months ago for a project turned into a thrilling experience in the end, it was definitely memorable town and great fun seeing most of you daily in forums and chat. Thanks to the core of RFM for being great as usually, thanks to the guests from Oozing Inn as I wanted to play with you so much in past and there was always something standing in the way. Finally thanks to the guests from outside of both teams, especially Aivaras and Hottest for being extremely active and willing to help in town progress and advising in chat/forums daily all the time. Ghost cheers for taking care of camping, I was so relieved on those days when having tons of work in real life. Joanne thank you for being you everyday, cheering everyone up with your incredible and catching (contagious) serene mood, even repetitive actions in this game are fun when you are around.</p><p>I`d like to say sorry to all of you for not noticing the better end-game plan for us to stay in the race for the win in the competition - until it actually started to give advantage to other towns in comparison to ours and 6fo towns - both decided to use 10 men inside strategy which turned out being wrong one. Since attacks on the 10 inside are so huge around and after day 30, it turned out that <em>all-camp strategy</em> was the only possibility to win.<br>While 6fo team is somewhat excused, since deciding to abandon the town and not using merchant would be surely very hard decision to make - I don`t have any explanation for our town, besides the fact that I haven`t thought that other strategy could be beneficial. In days 28+ I couldn`t be so active anymore as in first days - due to real life matters - to notice the all camp strategy applied by one of the french towns who started the end-game phase before us (they finshed ahead of us in the end thanks to it).<br>You all did awesome job during whole town lifespan and you didn`t deserve to be excluded from the race for the win in such a way, I can`t tell how sorry and ashamed I am because of this.</p><p>____________________________</p><br><p>Thanks again to the whole community for discussing the event at all the stages of planning and running, posting tons of funny and awesome posts.<br>There are certainly so many things that could have been improved in such competition. The biggest upset for me is that so many eager to join players were not allowed with very limited amount of spots. I hope that if there is another edition sometime, this issue is solved then. If 3 towns per server can participate, I think we could go with 5 as well in the future.</p><p>Thank you CountCount for making the Domini Notabili app in only couple evenings time, it`s incredible how supportive you were at the time of organisation of the event. The tool basically alone allowed to track everything what was going in all the towns and was big part of making this event such fun to participate in.</p><p>Congrats to all towns in other servers, the level of playing was amazing, also seeing the amount of logs and scrap collected by Gaulywood town and them defending day 30 inside was so impressive. Well played.</p><br><p>Just a note that since the competition is over, I`m sending the final results to Epoq reminding him of it being done, in hopes some great rewards will be prepared for the winning town/server and/or participants soon enough.</p><p>In case it`s interesting to anyone, all the players in Die2Nite server participating in UFC town received all the earned in town distinctions and only 1/3 of soul points at the time of being dead.</p>
