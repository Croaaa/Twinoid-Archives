Possibility of greater modifications in </strong>Private Towns<strong>.</strong> Not only things like changing amount of water (about water, there shouldn't be any limits, we should be able to set water amount to 0 if we'd want), or setting simple ghoul options.</p><p>There should be an option to modify almost everything in private towns. From changing item drop rates in selected zones, to setting selected player to ghoul (<strong>Trust no one!</strong>) or shaman. Or changing amount of zombies killed by a water bomb.</p><p><strong>2. Counsil of D2N leaders should be created.</strong><br>For example, Counsil would be able to create things like custom distinction (or emotes), and give them to players, as for event rewards.<br>They should also be able to announce new events on D2N forums and change seasonal leaderboard when it's time to.<br>Every month(?) there would be an election for players to join The Counsil.</p><p><strong>3. Greater amount of actions that are available to a player.</strong> Why can't we for example go to someone's house and kiss player inside?<br>Or tie a player on the front side of Town's Gates.<br>Wait... do we even have a rope in game?</p><p><strong>4. Introduce Halloween items and actions!</strong></p><p><strong>5. Shovel. </strong>Why there's no shovel that we can use on desert, in order to find items faster? That'd be a rare item, decreasing search time from 2 to 1.5 hours. Everyone can use it, except scavengers. They already have their own shovel!</p><p><strong>6. Unlock hero professions for everyone!</strong> Not only for those paying for it! You may eventually introduce ingame currency too, but possible to gain only from things ingame, like healing other player, or using a bandage on him (at the moment we can't do it, because <strong>WE NEED</strong> greater amount of actions, as I mentioned before).</p><p><strong>7. Disconnect Die2Nite from Twinoid</strong>, like it was in good ol' times. We need more action, more drama, that can't be guaranteed with Twinoid messages and integration. Along with it we need more changes, ie. not allowing to read/write on town's forum when we are outside of the town. Or allowing, but only if we have Radio Tower upgrade built in our house. That'd be finally good use of a <strong><em>laser diode</em></strong> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/surprise.gif" alt=":anim_surprised:" class="tid_ico"></p>
