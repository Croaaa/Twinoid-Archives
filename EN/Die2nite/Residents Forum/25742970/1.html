                <p>Story about the <strong>Technician</strong><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_tech.gif" alt=":hordes_tech:" class="tid_ico"> Tamerous:</p><p>On my <strong>first experience</strong> as hero, I got Brother In Arms from a friendly hero in a small map after I was terrorized and stuck in a zone outside the town. No one went to help me but the hero's friend (which was a shaman) just barely before the attack and promptly gave me a valium and a BiA thus. I choosed Technician because I wanted to do something for the town even if it didn't helped me. This was also the first time I heard about more active groups "meta's/coalitions" working together to ultimately survive as long as possible. I was too inexperienced to join them, but I was free to try again later on if I wanted.</p><p>However the town still unfortunaly died. And I barely missed out on LMS with a 50% chance too! However the extra 6 CP for workshop/constructions feels very usefull since it replenished daily after the attack.</p><p><strong>The second time</strong> when I was Technician on my own, I've found my very first expedition ruin in a small map - Prompting several enthusiastic players about it and two citizens including me and the ghoul (at that time I didn't knew) planned an expedition to go there. Little did I knew that after stamping my first keys in my first run ever in the expedition ruin that he would eat me up<img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_zhead.gif" alt=":hordes_zhead:" class="tid_ico"> when I exited the ruin.</p><p>Fortunaly for me, I knew another player in the town and she enacted revenge by punching the ghoul<img src="../../../../gfx/square/psycho.png" alt=":psycho:" class="tid_ico"> after he came back to the town and made the keys. Unfortunaly though because all of that happened the town didn't last long because they distrusted each other apparently. Not something I would blame them for.</p><p>I've had multiple smaller/distant maps as Technician randomly. They weren't very successfull I must say, but thanks to that I had an extra 6 CP I did managed to pull buildings that would be otherwise not being able to be finished or just the spare CP on use on weapon repair.</p><p><strong>My last town</strong> as Technician I had a very tough time. We've finally found the expo... But it was 16 AP away! When I entered with the Aquasplash I got bugged in a corner. Unable to move on Firefox I was forced to wait until I got kicked out of it with a wound. When I requested help, no one helped me and Argh! was coming all too soon. I decided to Heroic Return since I did not wanted to take the chance of camping in a nearby other building.</p><p>After using the last bandage I was asked again by the citizens in town to run the expo. Initially I refused since they did not wanted to help me when they wanted me to make the key stamps. However we were in desperate need of more blueprints if the town was supposed to survive. Mustering my courage as only active Technician (other two were lazy) I went back to the ruin, armed with nothing but a small water pistol I entered the ruin. 6 stamps had to be made for 6 doors. Flipping on my screenrecorder I went in with it. Killing one zombie... Two shots left. Killing another... One shot left. By that time I had taken 4 stamps out of 6. Meeting suddenly another zombie around the corner. Shooting it straight in the face with my last pistol and trying to reload it with a water ration I found earlier in the ruin... But it was poisoned!<img src="../../../../gfx/square/zombie.png" alt=":zombie:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I had to discard both since they were useless and I needed the two slots for the last two keystamps. Hoping furiously that I have enough time left for no escape incase of a zombie group came in since I was making a very big circle (who closes doors on the other side of the starting zone seriously?) and I was getting pretty low on Oxygen by now at 30%. Taking a few turns in this endless maze I finally reached the 5th door. Stamping it. 20% left on Oxygen.</p><p>Here I was thinking "Ah yes, I can easily reach the last closed door to take an imprint and then get the hell out!"</p><p>... Pretty wrong<img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_warning.gif" alt=":hordes_!!:" class="tid_ico"> I was when I suddenly got stuck with no weapons in a zone with 4 zombies. It was ticking slowly from 19 to 18%.</p><p>Damn good thing I took a 6 month subscription on this game. Epoq you owe me a camera light bulb every time I start in a new town! So I used that and it wor-NOT! 2 charges left. Currently 17% to 16%. I thought "Alright, so much for 90% chance! *HITS CAMERA BUTTON IN PANIC*" -Click- sound. No flash. 14% now to 13% of Oxygen left. I remember reading at the D2N Wiki that the 3rd camera use would be last, and around 40% chance left. Well so here I go inspecting the camera in 0.2 seconds and noticed that the lid was over the flasher. I flipped off the lid, pressed button called <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_arma.gif" alt=":hordes_arma:" class="tid_ico">"Nuclear Flash - Do not touch, experimental use by Epoq" and KABOOM flash! I also had my cool Technician glasses on so I didn't got blinded. And I thought "Hah finally out of this mess!" Well actually I wasn't since it was currently at 11% Oxygen left. I hurried to the last closed door, took an imprint of it and ran for the exit.</p><p>Ticking from 6%... Turning a corner... 5%... Running through the corridor seeing the light and a green "Exit" logo... 2%... Exiting through and barely escaped a wild run! I ran back to the town ofcourse sincce the two Tamers outside waiting for me were firmly asleep apparently since their dogs were nowhere to be seen. I hesitated to kick them awake but then again no time had to be wasted - the keys need to go back to the town! Halfway through I got stuck though because I didn't had any food or boosters with me. A friendly Tamer passing by after hearing my cries of mad laughter finally going to die in the middle of nowhere after escaping a narrow wound slapped my head, forced a twinoid<img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_drug.gif" alt=":hordes_drogue:" class="tid_ico"> through my mouth and gave me an alcohol (for adult use only - tagged by Epoq) and water ration and wished me luck and darted off to the expo ruin expecting probably the keys getting stamped at the workshop later so that they can start their full 10 room runs.</p><p>Anyhow long story short, I managed to get in the town. Other residents stamped them after half a day and after some days and most booster usage we've begun building what we needed to survive a bit longer. Unfortune for me I died outside after forgetting that I was terrorized and died a nameless death, adding one more to the endless horde of zombies attacking the town at the next night...<img src="../../../../gfx/square/twisted.png" alt=":sadist:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>That was the story of Meadow Technician Tamerous. The second entry will be made sometime later after napping in a zombie-free zone... With the profession being Tamer!

                <p>I was given, and still have, some hero days from a very generous fellow... I said I was going to make a story and I was told that this is the right place to put it.<br>I've always wanted to play as a <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_ranger.gif" alt=":hordes_eclair:" class="tid_ico"> and only recently did I...<br><em>Endless, for too many, that is how the desert must seem. An endless land of sand and heat, the shuffling corpses of the undead, relics of times forgotten buried just beneath one’s foot… But there is more to the desert and shuffling corpses of the undead than one would think, the shifting dunes tell stories and let us know where the things that many search for are actually hidden…<br>The man walked slowly, the rising sun hitting his back as he left quickly erased footprints in the sand that he walked upon. He wore an old, dark hood over his head that also doubled as a cape that he had wrapped around his body slightly. The land beyond the safety of the wall of the town were actually quite chill at this time of day, that would change as the sun would reach its peak ascent, and probably would change before that actually, but it didn’t matter to the citizen, his hood actually doubled as an insulator for the heat… No need to try and waste the water rations on a shower, he spared a glance back at the town that wasn’t too far off, having to shield his eyes from the sun they had been hitting his covered back.<br>They were all rowdy, not that he hated their company, they were just too loud and celebration sometimes, and other times they were bitter and resentful of one another, drinking away their fear and pain, some even taking drugs… They all tried different ways to occupy their minds from the terror and fear of certain death at being eaten alive. Whether they decided to bicker among themselves or play rather intricate games, it was none of his concern, as long as he kept his head down and didn’t cause any trouble, he was sure he was fine… The only one like him was the odd fellow with a ‘survival’ book, apparently he was in the town for some time, and then one day he found the book and was gone for a whopping five days, many considered him dead and started to write something in the log, but he was seen that day coming back perfectly fine and much wiser about the dunes.<br>He was too weird, and too much of a hermit for the cloaked citizen, and thus, he turned away from his town and continued walking… He didn’t always leave this early, he was a man of secrecy and had built himself drapes, and a lock so no one but him would see the nice, soft Mattress he had… Although he didn’t sleep long, and not till the zombie attack was over really, he did sleep better than most and was content with just taking the time to read over his notes and work in the lab, build something for the town’s people… The talk of someone improving their own house and being possibly hanged made him leave town though, he didn’t want to partake in something like that, wasting resources and deciding if someone should live or not… That should be left up to random chance and probabilities…<br>He stopped not only his train of thought but his movement as well, and he glanced at a dune ahead. He had yet to explore this area, but just from being this close he knew there were zombies on the other side… How many though? He lowered himself to a crouch on the ground, the distant moans sounding in his ears like the slight wind… He counted in his head, and did so many times over, and came to the conclusion that there were five of them shambling about; perhaps one was a fool that had gone missing the night before? It didn’t matter, but he was going to check anyways.<br>He climbed over the dune, and, now at the top, was able to see that there was actually only four zombies instead of the previously estimated five, he could take these four on if he wanted, but he instead simply slid down and walked right past one, almost brushing shoulders. He was a ghost, invisible to them, and many questioned why. Many said it was because he smelt different… They were wrong, he smelt just as bad as everyone else, but it was two things that saved him from the undead caring about him, he didn’t touch them, he covered as much as he could with his nasty looking green cloak, and he walked silently. They were not hound dogs, although some could smell if he got too close, the one he had gotten close to had his nose apparently missing, he had to only worry about their other senses.<br>Now in the middle of the group, he sat down on the sand and took out a small notebook and a pen, starting to scribble notes down in it about the area. Many seen this as him studying the undead, which he sometimes did, but this was actually to take in account how much sand seemed to be where, if a hidden road was buried, and any almost gone drag marks made by the undead. These things told him how long the zombies had been here, where they had come from, and if there was a possible building nearby, something forgotten from the time before… All of this.<br>He frowned slightly as he was able to trace the zombies from two directions, on the right of him, and in front. Ahead of him many more moans than before, it was almost an orchestra of noise from there…<br>And walking to their revealed a tangled mess of a building, it was hard to tell what it was, but it had foliage all over it and sand, to most, no one would be able to tell what it was… The nine or so corpses walking around it also discouraged anyone from getting near it, but not this man, this cloaked man merely shrugged at the zombies and walked closer to the buried building. He weaved his way past zombies and odd sand piles before coming to another crouching stop by the building, taking out his notebook and starting to scribble down notes. The size of the building and the shape, the parts of the sine he could see, maybe a few things that he could see past the foliage like labeled bottles… It was obviously a store, maybe a medical one? He got up started walking around it, sometimes there were clues on the side of the buildi-The hood came off and the branch scratched his face slightly.<br>Instantly he whipped around, muttering a curse at himself for being too close to the building and getting his hood knocked off by an old dead branch, it didn’t matter, if his hood came off and he was near any zombie, they’d know, and soon enough, they circled around him and began moaning even louder. The rotting meatbags would attack unless he got closer to them, it was odd, but they only attacked at one time of the day… But sadly for them, they were circling around a citizen that always came prepared, he knew the land he traveled and understood the dangers, even considered a superhero with powers due to his ability to survive, and as he reached to his backpack that was hidden by the cloak, he pulled out something he was sure the town wouldn’t miss for a little bit, he’d give it right back once he returned…<br>It didn’t matter if it was a bloodied chainsaw or not after all, the people just wanted to know how many zombies would be in the area...<br>None would be.</em></p>

                <p><strong>Residency:</strong></p><p>It was amazing how the sunset, an artistic masterpiece seen every day of one's life, could transform the desolate landscape of a shantytown into a golden-lined metropolis.</p><p>The irony of this matter, though, was how beautiful the sunset was, yet how much destruction and death it left after its daily routine had been completed.</p><p>Peering over my shoulder, I glance at my friend, who aimlessly adjusts a makeshift camp; the one we will take our last breaths of life in.</p><p>Another sad bit of irony was the fact that this beautiful view was seen mostly by those who were, well, going to die. Being out here in the wastes, at this time of day and seeing the town from this angle outside the walls, meant three things:</p><p>Either you were lost and helpless, an expert camper, or you had been shunned.</p><p>Sadly, my friend and I found ourselves in the boat of the ladder.</p><p>Being shunned had never been part of our plan. You see, the nature of humans is ultimately to gain power. Whether that power be through dominance, strength, corruption, intelligence, wealth or some other source, it would always bring another lesser human crashing beneath the powerful ones. Such a struggle for power normally spawned from one source of power viewing another source of power as a threat; something that would take their power away. And as human nature proves again and again, one source of power will become hostile towards the lesser source of power; thus the struggle for power ensues. The domination of the dominant power source, though, leaves the lesser source defeated and in a weak and vulnerable state.</p><p>This, in a sense, had happened to my friend and I.</p><p>Sitting in the desert while staring at a distant town, the safest place at night, during sunset would leave you to understand in this scenario which source of power had come out dominant, and which had been left defeated in a weak and vulnerable state.</p><p><strong>You guessed it:</strong> my friend and I were far down shit creek.</p><p><em>Very far.</em></p><p>Left wounded by a immoral clan known as <em>"The Family",</em> my friend and I had no energy left, and were essentially left to die.</p><p>As the sun sets, the shimmering gold-lined metropolis fades away, and the shantytown becomes an eyesore once more. My friend and I glance at each other. We do not speak, yet we say a million words.</p><p>As the ground begins to radiate small tremors, and the sand begins to slightly move, we know the end is near; the darkness and death of the night is nearly upon us. We close our eyes.</p><p>For this is the life of a resident in our world. Beneath all others, we carry on. Our simple ways do not measure in magnitude, nor immensity; but in raw multitude and sheer numbers. Without residents, the greatness of the known heroes would be nonexistent, nonentity, extinct. Similar to the relationship between the good and the bad; without the good, in comparison, there would never be bad. Vice versa.</p><p>We are residents. Our job is simple, yet crucial; to work. To carry the heavy burden, or the workload that comes hand in hand with survival.</p><p>My friend and I lay in the desert, an attack aspiring. We have taken the shunning bullet of instability and inequity in this post apocalyptic society. But like all valuable and good residents, we will live on to continue to do great things; not through fame or fortune, nor through amazing abilities like that of a hero, but in aggregation, assemblage and collection. Our names will not be remembered, but our actions will be.</p><p>For through hard lessons we have learned the true meaning of being a resident. It is too bad the world may never know what we know, <em>what it means to be a true resident,</em> because sadly, but surely, we will <strong>Die2Nite.</strong></p>

                <p>Well... I must say I'm disappointed. Not because of not winning the hero days, though those would've been nice. I'm disappointed because I put a rather significant amount of time and effort into my entry, under the assumption that it would be judged in quality against the other entries. I really am depressed to think that the 'winner' was decided by something so mean as dumb luck, blind chance. I don't envy those who got (I won't say win in the second case) the hero days, but this experience has made me unlikely to enter any contests hosted by you again, NyxOwl. If you feel as if you were unable to judge whichever entry is best of the writings, then I question why you put that as a category to enter the contest in. And if you simply feel as if they were all of such quality that you could not decide which one was best, then perhaps a poll of the audience, or the contestants would've worked. Anything but chance, really. I was really looking forward to seeing how my own effort measured up to the other entries, primarily Meadow's, 065tdsa's, and especially DrJamez (I felt yours best answered the prompt and kept with the spirit of the competition). I must say, this whole experience has left me rather... hollow.</p>
