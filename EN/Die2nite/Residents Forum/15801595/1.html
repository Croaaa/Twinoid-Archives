                <p>It has been years since the apocalypse. A team of investigators, reclaiming the sandy wastes, find the wreckage of an old, destroyed town. What resources remain are almost unusable— but, one investigator makes a lucky discovery.</p><p>A journal is found, with a strange, Olympics-esque symbol on the cover. Inside, a resident kept a diary all through the lifetime of his town.<br>This is the story of that town.</p><p>This is the story of <strong>Laziness of cannibals</strong>.</p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">(This is a town journal that I wrote when I was taking part in the Apocalympics. It is being reposted here in parts for your viewing pleasure.)</span></p><p><em>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</em></p><p><strong>Day 1</strong></p><p>We're saved! This morning, <strong>MayorGriffonn</strong> led me and the other 39 survivors to a small ruin of a town, a beacon in this dense desert. It's not in good shape. There's walls, but they're patchwork things made of metal, and in some places, cardboard. <br>The town does have a pair of strong gates. No one else seems to be present. There is also a well, full of fresh water. It's been decided: the town will become our new home, as we try to hold out for as long as we can. If the zombies were to attack here, a few might die— from tetanus.</p><p>Our first order of business is finding supplies. In our trek from the ruins of our old town, we have eaten every scrap of food, and drank every drop of water we had. When the food ran out, those who collapsed along the way were eaten. 100 survivors became 80, and then 65. By the time our new town appeared in our sight, only 40 of us remained.<br>We've stepped out of the gates to scavenge supplies for our new home. I am no exception— with a canteen of the well's water, and a tasty-looking melon I found hidden under my new house's mattress, I have trekked to a spot around 5 km from town. It is time to see if the desert will yield anything useful.</p><p>Success! After meeting <strong>goodnames</strong>, one of my fellow survivors, I searched, and have found a roll of duct tape, poking out from beneath the sands. I’ll keep looking.</p><p>It’s been over ten hours now. In addition to the tape, I also managed to unearth an old mattress, a half-empty bottle of pills labeled ‘Paracetoid antibiotic’, several twisted old planks, and a chicken! A live chicken! I will head back to town soon, and deliver my findings.</p><p>I had to leave the animal behind, as intriguing as it was to see a living being in the desert. The flapping thing took up too much space in my pack, which was already jammed. I found myself having to leave other items behind as I came upon more bounty upon my return trip— a bag full of assorted nuts and bolts. More tape. A strange gun that appeared to use batteries as weapons. <br>I left a trail of items as I moved towards town, and eventually took back the antibiotic, the bolts, the mattress, and one of the planks. Everything else would have to wait.</p><p>I returned to town to discover some of my companions had made improvements. A crude watchtower rose at one corner of the walls (helpfully blocking one of the most cardboard-y sections), and a large building, a barn, had been refurbished as a sort of workshop. Another large building had been designated the ‘bank’, and here we placed the results of our searching.</p><p>We had made progress. I placed my bolts on top of the pile (I’d dragged the mattress over to a hole in the outer wall and left it there), and dropped the antibiotic in one corner and the plank in the other. <br>A pile of dusty papers near where I had put the plank caught my eye. It was a stack of blueprints. One detailed plans for an enhanced lock for the gates. Another, the tower that had already been built. A third explained a means of reinforcing the walls. <br>This explained how the others had known what to do to improve the town— they had architectural help.</p><p>As I examined the piles, <strong>mamenity</strong> came in with a new blueprint, putting it on the pile. I looked at it. It was some sort of automatic lock for the front gate.<br>The other scavengers had found useful items as well. <strong>FirebugZane</strong> had found a busted old coffee machine somewhere, while MayorGriffonn had found several pints of beer, hardly even dusty.</p><p>A shout from the tower broke me out of my overview. <strong>ishimu</strong> and <strong>KittyKatz</strong> were perched at the top of it, and they had disquieting news. <br>Some of the zombies from our old town had followed us. From the sound of it, about 20 to 50 were slowly shuffling towards the gates. They’d be here by midnight.<br>I climbed the ladder and took a look myself. There were less than 50, that much was certain. KittyKatz revised the estimate down a bit. “OK, 20 to 40, then,” he said.</p><p>We need to be all inside the town before midnight. Four of the survivors had gotten trapped by zombies in the desert, and had to be recovered. (We’ve found one person can fend off about two zombies on their own. More than that, you’re in trouble.) <br>As I write this, the horde has come closer; they will hit us in around an hour. 7 people are still outside. May they make it home safely.</p><br><p>The horde is almost upon us. I have spent my last ounce of strength working on a pump for the town well. <strong>ReplaY021</strong> has closed the gates. All I can do now is hide in my tent.</p><p>May we survive. May those poor three left outside the walls live through the night.</p><p><em>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</em></p>

                <p><em>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</em></p><p><strong>Day 2</strong></p><p>Last night, I dreamed of a kingdom.<br>A great country, where one could grow, and hold territory. The dream changed to a grid of changing symbols, gold, people, food, wondrous things... and death, inevitable as time passed. War and diplomacy, ruin and creation. The cycle of life continued.<br>The clanging of the watchtower bell woke me.</p><p>We had survived our first night. 24 zombies had approached the town, but the walls had held firm. Less happily, the three caught outside— <strong>goodnames</strong>, <strong>funi</strong>, and <strong>Vinin</strong>— didn’t survive their night in the desert. May they rest in peace (though I suspect they won’t.)<br>MayorGriffonn has insisted from now on that if we scavenge far, we must bring a partner with us.</p><p>My partner for today is ReplaY021. I have met with him 4km east of town and brought him some food— along the way, I gave a steroid pill I’d found to <strong>AnachroNia</strong>. He’ll see it home safely.<br>We have journeyed even farther east, making a loop. There are a number of scavenged resources here, left behind from yesterday. I found a large, heavy toolbox of some sort, as well as more bolts. ReplaY has found an old copper pipe, and a battery gun like the one I found the day before. We’ll now start heading back, and scavenge along the way.</p><p>We’ve now been scavenging for several hours. I found a knife, and pried open the toolbox. Inside were more nuts and bolts. It’s a relief not to have to carry that heavy thing around. We’ve agreed to split up, and search separate (but adjacent) areas of the desert.</p><p>~</p><p>It’s been several hours, and I can hear it over the radio. <strong>Arzanian</strong> has snapped! He was trapped in the desert by some zombies, and now he keeps ranting about wanting to kill KittyKatt! We’re trying to find out why...<br>Oh my god. Arzanian’s said he killed his... last town? Not quite sure what he’s talking about. He says he’ll go back to helping, but... if my tent could be locked, I’d lock it. He says everything’ll be better after he kills KittyKatt. What is going on here?!</p><p>Oh. After we tried our best to talk Arzinian down, he suddenly burst out laughing. He says he was kinda serious about it at first, but we kept carrying on about it so much that he decided to string us along a bit. Then he pointed out that it would be extremely hard for him to kill KittyKatz.<br>I feel kinda stupid for falling for that.<br>Going to move a bit towards town. I’ve dug so many holes that this stretch of desert looks like it has measles.</p><p>ReplaY and I met up a few hours later. Our journey home took us through a region with two zombies, both of which ReplaY obliterated with his battery-firing gun. We danced with joy when the walls of the town finally came into view.</p><p>~</p><p>The town looked even better now that I’ve returned. Many citizens have already set up crude tents. Should some lucky zombie breach these walls, perhaps the thick canvas will dissuade them. We’re also building a ‘study’, for the drafting of blueprints— one of the prints in the bank had a scrawled note that if you bring vodka and steroids enough together, people can get suddenly creative. <br>I don’t understand how that works.</p><p>Also, <strong>DrJamez</strong> found an old telescope, sitting at the back of an old cabinet. KittyKatz has installed it in the watchtower. Not only can we see the zones around us, we can even get a glimpse of far distant lands.<br><em>We are not alone.</em> There are 6 other towns in the wastes with us. They are far away— too far to travel in a day, or two, or even three. But we can see them.<br>The other towns appear to be doing well. All are bustling, and each sport their own watchtower, as well as wall upgrades similar to our own. One has a pump; two others have the same study we’ve built, and a third has it half-done.</p><p>We can see hordes of zombies approaching the other towns, too. Each town has a name; after <strong>KillSkill</strong> joked that ‘we were too lazy to become zombies’, we’ve called ourselves the town of <strong>Lazy Cannibals</strong>. <strong>Linktt</strong> painted up a big sign above the town gate.<br>We can’t really read the other town’s signs through the telescope, so we’ve taken turns making up names instead. One town, the <strong>Crazy Centre of Lost Souls</strong>, has an extra-big horde coming for it— 50 or 60 zombies! I hope they can survive intact. They have reinforced their fences with coils of thick barbed wire.</p><p>We have only a few zombies coming for us, and the reinforced walls will easily stop them.</p><p>~</p><p>Is it wrong to do a bad thing for the greater good? <strong>vasarhai</strong> was keeping a blueprint he’d found in his house, ‘for later’, he said. I couldn’t think why he’d want to save a possible key to our survival for later— it’s not like food, where you eat it and it’s gone.<br>So: I stole it.<br>The print turned out to detail a powerful form of armor plate to reinforce the walls. It’s not cheap— the amount of wood and iron required to build it is quite impressive— but it’s worth it.</p><p>I am worn out by exploring. I will rest now. When I wake up, the attack will be over and a new day will be beginning.</p><p><em>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</em></p>

                <p><em>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</em><br><strong>Day 3</strong></p><p>Today dawned pleasantly. Everyone made it in safely last night. Three people— <strong>Dath</strong>, mamenity and <strong>AmanRawr</strong>— decided to camp out in some of the abandoned buildings within the desert. They returned with a valuable blueprint each. Our ‘study’ has generated a print of its own. As well, other citizens have scrounged up architectural diagrams.<br>The new blueprints correspond to the following items:<br>• Some sort of mechanical upgrade for the pump. It appears it will require a solid foundation to work, though.<br>• A faucet, to fill water weapons from the well. It’ll also need a foundation.<br>• A drill for the pump, once we get one.<br>• Cannons that fire water, to fend off the zombie horde!<br>• Some sort of lighthouse... I’m not sure what it’s for, but it looks useful.<br>• A gadget that fits around the watchtower telescope and counts the number of zombies in any location in the desert.<br>• And, a sketch of... something involving a big mound of food? I don’t know.</p><p>It turns out that the 20 zombies that attacked us yesterday were just the small fish swimming in front of the shark. The watchtower reports a good horde of 100 zombies coming at us today! When I woke up, people had already taken action. The ‘wall’ blueprint I took yesterday was now a real thing. Another group of people had dug a large pit around the town, and some others had fashioned barbed wire above the pit. Still, from the looks of it, we could end up with 10 or 15 zombies inside the walls unless someone builds something more.</p><p>I have gone out scavenging one more time. A quick check of the desert map we keep in town showed a bag of cement, some ways southeast of the town. I managed to trek out there, then poured my water ration onto the bag to save space in my pack; I have found a pen-knife, which should hopefully protect me from the zombie horde. After a ‘lunch’ of old chewing gum, I went as far south as I dared. I wasn’t alone— two zombies warily circled me. I stabbed one with my knife.<br>Nothing happened. I blinked, pulled the knife out, and stabbed the zombie again. This time, the penknife blade shattered.<br>Cursing, I got as far away as I could before digging my first hole to search.</p><p>It’s been a few hours. The area’s almost certainly picked clean now. I’ve found some usable iron, a plank, and a large 12V battery. Time to head back to town.</p><p>Things are much the same now that I’ve returned. The town has a pump for the well, now, and we’re readying construction of some piles of supplies outside the walls, where we can grab them for emergencies. They should close the gap and protect us from the zombie horde tonight. I’ve helped fill one of the piles.</p><p>Argh! What is <strong>SexToys</strong> doing building a foundation in the center of town?! If people keep up like this, someone is going to die tonight.<br>I have taken some of the iron from the construction site to my tent, and am now sitting on it (literally). There is enough to accumulate the emergency supplies, but not enough to reinforce the foundation. This should set the building on track.</p><p>I took a quick nap, as I was tired out from all the work I’d done. When I woke, there was an angry note on my door, ranting about blocking construction sites.<br>I don’t know who it was from, but I looked around and saw the supply piles were finished. I dragged the metal back to the bank.<br>The foundation in the center of town was also finished— I’m happy this town is so productive. We have just enough defense to turn away the entire zombie horde tonight.</p><p>Up on the watchtower, vasarhai has been doing some time with the telescope. <strong>Crazy Centre</strong> lost two more people tonight, and don’t have the blueprint study we built. I hope they can hold out for a while. Another town, <strong>Roads of Sand</strong>, has what looks like half the mattresses in the world propped up against the front gates!! They don’t have many buildings near town to search, though, and they don’t have a study either.</p><p>The third town out there, <strong>Insanitary Bay of Cyclops</strong>, is facing a huge horde! Huger than ours, that is. They’ll be able to keep out only half the zombies, from the looks of it. I fear for their survival... <br>They have a lovely vegetable patch, according to vasarhai. I’m starting to get hungry.<br>The other three towns seem to have everything very shipshape.</p><p>One more thing before I go back to sleep: Linktt ate an old, meaty bone that someone found after the attack on the first day. I don’t know what was in it, but he came down with a high fever... so he used the paracetoid antibiotic I brought in. I’m not sure why he ate something so foul-smelling, but hopefully we can use the bone for something.</p><p>Closing the gates now. I wonder how things’ll be tomorrow?</p><p><em>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</em></p>

                <p><em>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</em></p><p><strong>Day 4</strong></p><p>Last night, I dreamed of a snake.<br>A fruit-eating snake, slithering around on a playing-field made of cards, lusting after fruit as it grew longer and longer. Could it find a way out, or was it doomed to crash and die?<br>The question occupied me long after I woke up.</p><p>Today, me and some others went on a scavenging trip to a buried ruin southeast of town. I was told to bring food and water, as well as a water pistol to fight off the zombies. <br>However, the bank was completely out of food! I grabbed a bottle of vodka instead. Myself, Dath, MayorGriffonn, and <strong>Taylork2</strong> set out from town in a group.</p><p>Our trip south was uneventful. When we started walking east, we ran into zombies. Dath hacked some down with his machete, and Taylork2 got three with his water pistol. I cleared out zombies around the ruin itself with mine.<br>As we were approaching the ruin, we heard a human voice hailing us. It was <strong>fdamned26</strong>! He tossed us some steroids and stayed to help us clear the area.<br>Clearing buildings is tiring work. I need a pick-me-up. <br>It’s time to drink an entire bottle of vodka.</p><p>~</p><p>[what follows is written in a shaky, and nearly illegible, hand]</p><p>I fell in a hole!</p><p>This building is— is— what is it? No, it’s not a building yet. It’s a site of constructions. Like the constructions in our town. Was this a town? What was this?</p><p>There’s twice as many zombies here as there should be! Good thing everybody’s split into two to finish them off.</p><p>I fell in another hole!</p><p>There’s two many too many whole holes here. I’m going to load up our old stuff and search back over backwards.</p><p>I think I tripped into a hole! Wheee</p><p>Who keeps digging these holes, anyway? Is it me?</p><p>I found a can! And metal? Like that metal I tripped over in the building!</p><p>You know what I think? I think this town is... I think I am.... I think I gotta...</p><p>[The rest of the page is splattered with something thick and putrid. At the bottom of the page, someone has added an annotation in thick black ink:]</p><p><strong>Note to self: Do not explore while drunk. Finding things is almost impossible, and you will fall on your ass.</strong></p><p>[A further annotation has been added in the margin:]</p><p><strong>Repeatedly.</strong></p><p>~</p><p>Sorry about that. After drinking myself into a stupor, I decided to head back, packed up the depleted water pistols we’d used into a manbag and started retracing my steps. I also grabbed a large metal support that was lying around the building (it turned out to be an abandoned construction site). Dath and MayorGriffinn are camping overnight at the site, in hopes of finding something useful.<br>On my way home, I found some useful iron and an unopened can, lying where people had found them. I packed those into the bag as well.<br>The only thing I was able to dig up was a few rotting logs. I left them where they were. We can pick them up if we really need them.</p><p>Once I got home, I discovered something very worrying.<br>The well is dry.<br>It’s not as bad as it sounds. There’s a big pile of water rations stacked up in the bank, and we have blueprints for projects that’ll dig deeper and find more water. The town will survive today’s outbreak easily— thanks to the study, today’s blueprint (plywood wall reinforcement) has already been added to our ever-thickening walls. There’s a project underway to build a drilling rig and refill the well. That should take some of the pressure off.<br>We also found a sketch of a crude henhouse. If we can find chickens to put in it, the townspeople will enjoy fresh eggs!</p><p>Good news from the watchtower: <strong>Insanitary Bay</strong> was able to raise its defenses in time. <strong>Crazy Centre of Lost Souls</strong>, however, lost a lot of people— most of whom were locked out when the citizens had to close the gates. The horde approaching them today appears to be relatively low, however.<br><strong>Taciturn Lakes of Thirst</strong> is having problems. They have 30 or 40 more zombies coming than their walls are prepared to handle! I hope they can find the defenses to repel them...</p><p>I will take a break from scavenging tomorrow. I had a nap when I got back, but I still feel horrible. Don’t drink and scavenge, kids.<br>~Goodnight~</p><p><em>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</em></p>

                <p><em>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</em><br><strong>Day 5</strong><br>Ah, my head! It feels like it’s been split open. I’m not doing <em>that</em> again.<br>We lost four more citizens today. <strong>Arzanian, Koola, SexToys</strong>, and <strong>SirTakis</strong> were all caught outside when <strong>GabitzBoy</strong> closed the gates. I’ll hope they rest peacefully, in perhaps a pond or lake. The three who died before assaulted us the next night as zombies. <br>It would have been more, but FirebugZane was saved by mamenity.</p><p>The zombie horde has swelled. I have been on construction duty today, and we have built the drilling rig. The well is no longer dry; with it active, we have constructed a misting device that should stop a large number of zombies. We are also constructing cannon emplacements, and, if we can gather the materials, a flock of crude scarecrows that should confuse the zombies.<br>It may not be enough. We expect up to 30 zombies inside the walls tonight. Perhaps we can deepen the pit to make up the total.</p><p>We are not the only ones facing problems. All of the other towns except <strong>The Hospital of Bees</strong> have more zombies charging at them than they are prepared to handle. May they survive! From the crows flying over the other towns, it is easy to see that some have had more losses than others. <strong>Crazy Centre of Lost Souls</strong> was particularly hard-hit.</p><p>Upon hearing the news about the zombies, ReplaY021 got a sullen look, and started talking about committing suicide. About half-a-dozen other citizens have talked him out of it— we found cyanide, and now MayorGriffonn has taken it for safekeeping so he does not try to use it.<br>Town morale is uncertain.</p><p>We don’t have enough time to make the scarecrows. We’re going to set up some spikes instead and hope the zombies wander into it. <strong>IceKunni</strong> has gone out too far, and is at the Construction Site. He is going to camp there— it’s that or die on the sands.<br>Here in town, we will deepen the pit, but I don’t think we have time to even build the spikes. If we’re lucky, that’ll be enough. If not, at most 5 people will die. I think.</p><p>I’ve closed the gates, and I’m going to hide under my mattress.</p><p><em>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</em></p>

                <p><em>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</em><br><strong>Day 6</strong><br>Last night, I couldn’t sleep. I sat rigid in my tent and listened to the town walls bowing in under the pressure of 237 zombies. <br>However, the walls held. No zombies made it in with us. IceKunni, trapped at the construction site, also survived.</p><br><p>This morning, there was a big argument about what to do. fdamned26 insisted he wanted to visit an abandoned bunker, over 9 km away. We talked him into saving IceKunni instead, and he opened the gates and charged out as fast as he could.</p><p>Meanwhile, there was the question of how to hold off the horde. We are reinforcing the walls, and have a blueprint for some large cannon that will fire water at the zombies. However, it needs time to get up, and I’m not sure the well can handle it.<br>We’ve decided to work on that and the mechanical pump upgrade, but you should have heard the arguments before we decided!</p><p>~</p><p>Just heard a call for help over the radio. For some strange reason, fdamned26 dropped his water pistol in the desert and is now trapped by zombies. I’ve got rescue duty— have loaded up with steroids, battery launcher, and water for me and am heading there at all speed.</p><p>Have killed 2 zombies where fdamned26 is. The zone, amazingly, hasn’t been picked clean! I’m going to stay and search a little while.</p><p>~</p><p>This piece of ground has been amazingly productive. IceKunni joined me, and we just finished digging through the last of the area. We found a battery gun, a strange green costume, and some food and drinks! Also, raw materials and iron (which the town sorely needs for building.) I am taking back the steroids I came in with (didn’t need), some food, a screwdriver fdamned26 took to open chests, and some iron back to town. IceKunni says he’ll follow fdamned26 to safety.<br>Rescue achieved!</p><p>In town now. Everybody is packed into the workshop, turning metal into support beams for the mechanical pump and water turrets. We will just about be able to make the zombie defense today, either by deepening the pit, or by erecting some flimsy wooden spikes by the front gates (we almost finished them yesterday, but never actually put them out there.) We’ll make it, today and tomorrow!</p><p>The telescope shows several of the other towns might be in trouble. <strong>Crazy Centre of Lost Souls</strong> and <strong>The Outdated Port</strong> have many zombies approaching them.<br>Also, something strange: Three people have fallen around the well in <strong>Taciturn Lakes of Thirst</strong>, hands reaching desperately towards it. Are they living up to their name?</p><p>The spikes are in place. <strong>Omnifire</strong> put the finishing touches on them, though I don’t quite understand the purpose of the fuzzy dice hanging from the largest one. The rest of the town is working on augmenting the pump a bit. We’re getting a little more water; it won’t be like the yield when the mechanical pump is completed, but it’ll tide us over until then.<br>Morale is high. We have a decent chance of survival.</p><p>We can do this!<br><em>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</em></p>

                <p><em>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</em><br><strong>Day 7</strong></p><p>The sound of hammering and sawing woke me today. 6 zombies got through the walls last night, and <strong>Prolapse</strong> was scared stiff! No one was eaten, though, and Prolapse calmed down after smoking a cigarette.</p><p>While I was out in the desert yesterday, everyone in town was working on readying the mechanical pump. It’s now finished. The well is once again full, and a number of people have breathed sighs of relief. People are filling canteens and putting them into the bank, so that the water turrets can finally be finished.</p><p>I’m out to scavenge raw materials from the depleted areas around town. On my way out, though, I’ve seen the turrets— they’re mounted on the mounds we constructed earlier, and look like nothing so much as giant lawn sprinklers. The zombie horde tonight is in for a surprise.</p><p>~</p><p>Yipe! I walked a little ways east of town, and suddenly I was trapped by four zombies! I didn’t know they’d come right up near the town walls. There were two logs on the ground. I rolled the logs into my pack, then signaled to the watchtower.</p><p>Three days ago, someone came up with a bright idea: Keep a coil of rope and a clever pulley attachment in the tower. Then, if a citizen is close enough and wants to come in, they load up the rope and toss one end to the scavenger, who ties the rope to anything really heavy, and holds on tight themselves. I waved, and they tossed the rope.<br>Once I was fully hanging on, GabitzBoy, on tower duty, grabbed on to the other end of the rope and jumped off the tower, his weight pulling me over the walls (I had to push off with my feet to avoid the barbed wire) and into the tower myself.</p><p>After my fright, I decided to scavenge somewhere to the west of town, instead. I found one more log there; then, I walked back to the town gates and dumped my bounty of logs into the Bank.</p><p>~</p><p>The turrets are now fully operational. A quick test-firing has blotted a wet arc in the desert. It won’t quite be enough to stem off the horde coming at us today, though. Over 400 zombies! We are gathering materials to build some crude scarecrows around the pit. Last night’s spikes served us well, skewering 15 zombies— but, they broke. We are rebuilding them as well.</p><p>AmanRawr has set off into the desert to camp in the small house, northeast of the town. vasarhai has gone to help him improve the camp site. However, AmanRawr has returned, instead! It seems they changed their minds about who’s staying the night.</p><p>Meanwhile, some very strange news from the telescope crew. <strong>Mabachi</strong> said he saw a strange building in front of <strong>Crazy Centre of Lost Souls</strong>. Sort of a cage, with a chair in it. If someone sat in it (or was locked in it!) it’d certainly attract zombies, but... I’m not sure that person would survive the night. Is the town so desperate to sacrifice its own?<br><strong>Outdated Port</strong> might be having defense trouble again— we counted 6 zombie-munched corpses there early this morning. We’ll have to see what happens.</p><p>We have been low on food for some time. I have had chances to eat, sometimes... I think the last time was two days ago. Most food gets given to people who are scavenging in the desert— sometimes they find old takeout bags, as well.<br>The exception is the meaty bones stacked in a corner of the bank. After what happened to Linktt, no one wants to touch them. We think they’re human, too.</p><p>fdamned26 came into town just now, dragging a big crate of furniture parts behind him. When assembled, it turned out to be <strong>a sturdy wooden table</strong>. This’ll be the perfect addition to the workshop! Now it won’t be quite SO tiring to saw up the desert’s logs and smelt its scrap metal. <br>The spikes are done, and we’ll probably upgrade the shop tomorrow. The gates are closed, too.<br>Let’s survive with the best of them.<br><em>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</em></p>

                <p><em>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</em><br><strong>Day 8</strong></p><p>Last night, I dreamed of an arena.<br>A great, eternal arena, where men and women in bright costumes (it’s been so long since we had any nice clothing) took up a variety of weapons, fighting against one another, in elaborate tournaments and rankings. At the end of the fight, one person kneels and one person raises an arm in victory, and every day, contestants return to full vigor.</p><p>I miss the pre-zombie world.</p><br><p>This morning, the sound of angry shouting was my alarm clock. Apparently, in addition to the furniture, fdamned26 brought home a large plank, which he used to fix up his house. I’m not entirely sure who complained about it, but now the bulk of the townsfolk have banished him. All his stuff has been put into the bank, and a good half the town will chase him away from construction sites now.<br>Me and MayorGriffonn both think it was pointless.</p><p>More bad news: vasarhai hasn’t returned from his ‘desert vacation’. <strong>LLIBED</strong> saw his mangled corpse by the small house in the desert.<br>Because fdamned has been banished, about the only things he can do now are scavenge outside, or camp. We’ve decided he could try and camp where vasarhai died.<br>I’ve cleared his way a bit, and left him water and a water gun so he can get there.</p><p>The study produced a blueprint for a large gun that fires metal plates at the zombies. There’s a nifty rewind mechanism that pulls the plates back in for later use, too. We have built it. This cannon should be able to handle the current horde tonight.<br>What I’d like to know is, where is the horde coming from? We’ve only lost 9 people, but we’ve got over 450 zombies coming at us tonight. Whenever we dig in the desert, we never find corpses. Would a horde of zombies really trek across the desert for 31 human survivors?</p><p>New trouble: mamenity was trapped by zombies while exploring a zone that we hadn’t dug to shreds yet. I took a water pistol and went to bail him out. Once 3 of the 5 zombies trapping him were reduced to stinking puddles, I started digging alongside him.</p><p>~</p><p>We found a few things. I unearthed a busted shopping cart from who knows where. That’s our third. Was our town built on a mall? I also found a rather rusty chain. It’ll make a useful weapon.<br>mamenity found some iron, a battery, and some food and pharmaceutical products. It’s nothing brilliant, but it’ll keep our town going.</p><p>I discovered the workshop had been upgraded when I arrived in town. Working with wood and metal should be quicker now. A few people are upgrading their tents to real houses... well, a proper description would be ‘hovels’, but they’ll fend off a few more zombies. A crew of people is improving the pump, trying to bring a little more water to the surface.</p><p>One strange thing to note: <strong>leanderj</strong> appears to have perished. The day before yesterday, he camped in the derelict villa. The next day, the zombies trapped him there. But, he never called for help, or even came on the radio at all. Not once during the entire life of the town.<br>Very strange.</p><p>I am going out one more time, to see if I can find more low-grade materials (there seems to be no end to them). Our resources remain moderate, but there’s always a demand for more iron and wood. Hopefully I can come home with my sack bulging full!</p><p>~</p><p>One. Measly. Log. That’s all I found. I’m coming in. We are safe from zombies for the day. All that matters now is what happens tomorrow. The <strong>Crazy Centre of Lost Souls</strong> is having serious trouble, and will almost certainly be overrun. I believe they have only 16 citizens now. Also, <strong>Insanitary Bay of Cyclop</strong>s looks to be having defense problems. In <strong>The Hospital of Bees,</strong> citizens are circling around the well with a gaunt look on their faces. We’ll have to see how each survives the night.</p><p>I hope fdamned26 doesn’t perish in the open. mamenity came up with a ‘Master Plan’ for our survival, and me, he, and MayorGriffonn went around posting copies on every resident’s door. We also transmitted it over the radio, and I suspect the town is slowly coming together.<br>We <em>will</em> survive!<br><em>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</em></p>

MayorGriffonn kept it in his house, to make sure no one else used it. Maybe it could be used for something, after all.<br>Today, he mistook the box of pills for the deck of cards he had taken from the bank (he played a game every day), and before we knew what was happening, he was dead.</p><p>Mabachi has also died— of dehydration. It seemed preventable... last night I mixed up some pharmaceutical products and got two helpings of tablets that prevent thirst. I’m not sure why he didn’t use them.</p><p>On the bright side, fdamned26 has survived his little camping trip! The blueprint he brought back showed a bunch of small pits covered with thin wood, where zombies would walk over them and be tipped in. This will make a welcome addition to our defenses.</p><p>With Griffonn gone, we are holding elections for a new mayor. I have set up a tally sheet in the town square, so all can place their votes. I will read the result at the end of the day.</p><p>I have watchtower duty today. The zombie horde is less of a threat at the time being. Our current defenses will hold them off, but we are still making improvements— the new saying is, ‘A quiet horde today means a big rush tomorrow’. <br>As for other towns, <strong>Crazy Centre of Lost Souls</strong> is done for! The last night’s zombie attack all but battered the gates down! I saw three moving figures— three survivors— emerging from the rubble, but they can’t last long on their own.</p><p>Next, while I was retuning the tower radio, I caught a transmission from <strong>Insanitary Bay of Cyclop</strong>s. There were the sounds of a big argument. Apparently, 3 of the residents completely snapped, taking things from the bank and running out far into the desert. There, they killed themselves. What could have happened there to provoke such a reaction?</p><p>Finally, a survey of the other towns suggests some changes coming. Many of them appear to be very low on water (though it’s hard to tell from just a look through the telescope). <strong>Taciturn Lakes of Thirst</strong> is the exception. They appear to be a particularly resilient town. Will they survive when others falter?</p><p>~</p><p>I went back to the voting board to find a bunch of people had posted notes on it. A sort of consensus was forming, for a town council.<br>Dath had made the original proposal. His suggestion read as follows:</p><p>“DrJamez can be lead head<br>Me and mamenity can be head expeditionists<br>SIB and FoxMcCloud can be build control<br>And all together we'll be the disciplinary group of the town, that way no misunderstandings can happen.”</p><p>It seems to be gathering steam, and I like it. A town council it will be! The consensus now looks to be Dath, mamenity, and me.</p><p>~<br><strong><br>DrJamez</strong> is camping tonight, at the Garden Shed east of town. I hope he doesn’t get eaten by the horde on their way here! We could definitely use whatever blueprint he brings, though.<br>I could have sworn we already camped at the Shed before, though...</p><p>A number of people have upgraded their small tents to crude hovels now. One of MayorGriffonn’s dying commands was to build, and now people have. They’re nothing much to look at, but each hovel should be able to fend off a few more zombies than before.</p><p>Finally, got a call for help in from Dath. He was trapped just outside the range of the watchtower rope. I took some water from the well to energize myself, and grabbed a bottle of vodka for him. Then, I sprinted out to where he was, dropped the vodka, and headed back in. Pretty soon, I was pulling him over the town walls.</p><p>The true test will not be how many zombies are at us today, but how many will be there tomorrow. We’ll have to see...<br><em>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</em></p>

                <p><em>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</em><br><strong>Day 10</strong></p><p>Last night, I dreamed of a cool penguin and some hot monsters. Literally cool and hot, I mean. The penguin zooomed in on a rainbow and started freezing the monsters one by one! He finished each one off by strikes with a giant hammer.<br>Then, the dream changed. Suddenly, I saw the penguin going up to the monsters, and... making out... the whole island oscillating between heat and cold.<br>I woke up blushing.</p><p>Yesterday’s election results had to be amended. By popular demand, DrJamez was added to the council. He was a friend of MayorGriffonn, and helped gather our band of survivors. Fortunately, he survived his camping trip last night. mamenity has gone out to retrieve him.</p><p>Moreover, the horde approaching us is within our limits! With some spikes, a power boost to the water turrets, and a few other stopgap measures, we should be able to fend them off. One new defense we’re using is a special cannon. If you cut up some sheet metal and an iron support, the resulting shrapnel should shred a good block of zombies. We’ll need more metal if we want to use it again after tonight’s attack, though.</p><p>Linktt has built a shrine in honor of MayorGriffonn. When he first said he could hear the dead mayor’s voice, we dismissed it as wishful thinking. Then, <strong>Kollin</strong> put his ear up next to it. There, as clear as a slightly dented bell, was the voice of MayorGriffonn! He didn’t speak much, but he was still with us.</p><p>Me and mamenity have set up a plan for the day. When the defenses are done, everyone who can should have upgraded their houses again, using planks from the bank. This should keep us safe tonight— even with maximum defenses, 10 or 20 zombies might make it through. Poor IceKunni still hasn’t pitched a tent yet!</p><p>It’s frustrating that we can’t raise better defenses. The study pitched up an idea, for an extra-thick wall— but it first requires that a special framework be built, one that requires nuts and bolts. Quite a lot of nuts and bolts. We only have one bag left.<br>I have finished the spikes, and other survivors are placing their own touches on the cannon. Someone else has built a crude water-catching apparatus, to tip a few more rations of water into the well.</p><p>~</p><p>I re-ran the numbers. We will be able to hold of the zombie hordes perfectly tonight. ZoeBrooke is camping at the Citizen’s House just outside of town. Not everyone, though, is so lucky.<br>The telescope reports that <strong>Crazy Centre of Lost Souls</strong> is a dead town. The gates have been torn off their hinges. There are no survivors. Let us pause for a moment to commemorate them.</p><p>The other towns are doing somewhat better. None of them have the defenses to hold off the horde completely. There is a sign posted to <strong>Roads of Sand</strong>’s well, saying ‘NO MORE WATER’. They and <strong>Insanitary Bay of Cyclops</strong> are facing extra-large hordes.<br>Meanwhile, <strong>Taciturn Lakes of Thirst</strong> has built a little fountain by the well. A <em>fountain!</em> I don’t know how they managed it, but they must be swimming in water (so to speak). However, their walls won’t hold back all the zombies tonight. Will they make it?</p><p>We’ll have to see. I could go for one of those frosty drinks that penguin was sipping.<br><em>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</em></p>

                <p><em>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</em><br><strong>Day 11</strong></p><p>Today, I got up early, just as the last of the water was being emptied from the well. I kind of freaked out. We needed that water for the turrets, after all.<br>I was able to get the last two canteens of water, and a third from the bank. However, today was a day where we’d have to upgrade the water turrets, so we needed three more rations. And people were thirsty... including me.</p><p>We got the other three rations with a bit of luck. Someone gave up theirs, and the last two were obtained when Dath took some freshly mixed water purification tablets and tossed them into one of the old jerrycans of brackish water in the bank.</p><p>With the crisis over, I apologized for the false alarm. The question remains, though: how are the other people in town going to get their water?</p><p>~</p><p>OK, we finally have a plan for the day. We have to build 5 different items! There’s the Water Catcher, the Water Purifier (using our last bolts!), the Spikes, some more Armor Plating (we got the blueprint this morning), and we’ll reload that metal-firing cannon.<br>With the Purifier up, we’ll be able to filter out all our old jerrycans of water (we have 5 or 6 more).</p><p>The horde is being slightly discouraging. Even with all these constructions and the Water Turrets upgraded, about 25 zombies will get through the walls at minimum. I fear the size of the waves of zombies is increasing beyond our ability to hold them back.<br>The other towns are having problems, too. Last night, <strong>Roads of Sand</strong> lost over 10 citizens! They and <strong>Outdated Port</strong> are facing huge numbers— on the order of 1000 or more. I fear neither will survive.<br><strong><br>The Hospital of Bees</strong> is facing a smaller attack, but they are almost completely out of water, like <strong>Roads of Sand</strong>. Their days are numbered. <strong>Insanitary Bay’s</strong> well is almost empty, if all the large signs about rationing around the well are anything to go by. <br>Only <strong>Taciturn Lakes of Thirst</strong> appears to be doing well, with decent (?) defense and that damnable fountain. I feel thirsty just looking at it.</p><p>The Purifier is finished! We were able to add 11 rations of water to the well. We may yet be able to survive this. Still... we have no food any more. None of us have eaten for days. We are still not desperate enough to try eating the zombie-gnawed bones of our friends, however.</p><p>I have put the finishing touches on the spikes, and settled in to a nice game of cards. Closing my eyes in memory of MayorGriffonn, I drew a card.<br>It had the game rules on it. <br>I laughed and laughed. How appropriate! Plus, it made me feel better. A bit more energized. I am off to work on the Brutal Cannon.</p><p>The cannon is almost completed. omnifire drank an entire bottle of alcohol in one go (I remember when I did that!) so he could work on it. I’m thinking I may have to join him.<br>I closed the gates while he was shoveling metal into the cannons.</p><p>~</p><p>We are only minutes away from the attack. GabitzBoy ate some food he had been hiding, and finished the cannon. Me and Dath will add the water to the well so that the Turrets can seek their victims.</p><p>And then... I’ll go hide under the bed, again.<br><em>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</em></p>

                <p><em>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</em><br><strong>Day 12</strong></p><p>Last night, I dreamed of a happier place. A place full of games, all sorts of different amusements. Then, competition! People banding together, completing game-missions, solving puzzles, trying to do better than every other band.<br>There were strangely colored gems and stars in there too. It sounded like a nice place.</p><p>It’s finally happened: There is an enormous host of zombies coming at us today. 1,200 at the least! It is time for the town to fend for itself, as there will be zombies in the walls no matter what happens.</p><p>Some people are camping. Others (including me) are reinforcing their shacks into proper houses, and piling anything heavy they can find against the front door. My best guess is, staying in town gives chances of 50/50— or less. The bank is quickly emptying.<br>I have taken one of the gnawed arm bones, to give me a boost in an emergency. Will I really need such a gross thing? I hope not, but...</p><p>There is an attitude of despair in town. We were fortunate last night— 44 zombies got through the walls, but only one person— <strong>lemonpassion</strong>— was eaten. 7 people were scared out of their wits, though.<br>Our fellow towns are in dire straits as well. <strong>Insanitary Bay of Cyclops</strong> and <strong>Roads of Sand</strong> have only 8 citizens left. They’ll both be dead soon. <strong>The Hospital of Bees</strong> can only hang on for a bit longer before the dehydration deaths start. They and <strong>Taciturn Lakes</strong> are facing hordes only slightly smaller than ours. The <strong>Outdated Port’s</strong>, by comparison, is the biggest wave of zombies I have ever seen.<br>I fear for all of them. If I am alive tomorrow morning, I will update this with the other towns’ situations.</p><p>Mamenity has opened the gates, and several people have taken their belongings and headed out. How did it come to this? We thought we were saved when we first saw the town. Even the knowledge that 24 zombies had followed us was not enough to dampen our high spirits. But now...<br>24 turned into 1240... <br>Why does it have to end this way? Has anyone in the entire world survived without this threat? Is there some remote mountain where the zombies could not reach?</p><p>The Bank is almost empty now. The number of available materials is slowly depleting. The energy-boosting drugs have been snapped up. So has the alcohol. There is no water, though those that remain will upgrade the pump, in hopes of hanging on for a few more hours. Someone even took our one working radio.</p><p>DrJames and omnifire have left town. fdamned has decided to stand outside the gates tonight, arms spread wide, to end it all. I am hiding in my house. I have passed a torch to FoxMcCloud, to help scare one more zombie away. The sounds of zombies are audible even now, an hour before the attack.</p><p>This is the end. I leave the rest up to you, now.<br><em>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</em><br><span class="tid_sideNote">Note that this is NOT the end of the diary.

                <p>Hey, it's not over yet!</p><p><strong>The next day, writing appears in the diary in an unfamiliar hand:</strong></p><p><em>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</em><br><strong>Day 13 (DrJamez)</strong></p><p>Last night I slept at a Garden Shed with omnifire.<br>Seems like he was one of the few who were smart enough to get the hell out of town before what I like to call, the massacre, happened. So many people died... Over eleven, or a high number like that.<br>Funny, I walked to the town like the badass I was with no trouble from the one or two zeds I came across, and what do I come to find?</p><p>Blood everywhere in the town! There's only eleven of us now. Somehow the town is still organized and not chaotic!</p><p>I want to blame Dath for not letting us fall into chaos. It'd be fun to run butt naked through the town but someone has to make sure that we're still sane.... Boring as hell.</p><p>Speaking of boring, I came back to town and picked this trash up! I can't believe SoItBegins was writing a diary, I mean come on... What idiot puts all their thoughts into a diary? I've got some sticky fingers and was dressing up like a damn imp every few days to steal whatever I want. People have been so scared of the zeds they've been hallucinating and they chalked up my thefts as not really happening..... Idiots. SoItBegins is lucky I didn't snag this when I was stealing, be really embarrassing... I feel sad at the missed opportunity right there....</p><p>I don't think anyone knows who stole this... Well my name is DrJamez and well, I can't believe anyone would believe the lies me and Griffonn fed everyone.</p><p>I helped gather the forty citizens that went to this hell hole of a town and we told everyone that we'd be safe.</p><p>Funny story, we knew we wouldn't be safe but we needed the foolish trust of everyone. We were respected by everyone! First time we had the full respect of everyone!<br>It was great....<br>Oh, we had are trials and tribulations... It was a fun ride and it was all worth it in the end...</p><p>Griffonn's dumb soul still haunts me.<br>Really, when he died he left everyone for the most part, Except that silly little thing that one guy built, I wasn't paying attention but they could hear his voice through it.... Me however? He could talk to me still. I have no idea why or how but I could hear him in my head!</p><p>He told me things, good things... Keep going... Glad your still alive.... Hide the posion you made... Stuff like that.</p><p>I assure you I'm not crazy! Everyone else is crazy!</p><p>Anyhow today everyone's building their homes up even more, taking things such as old doors to further fortify their homes.... It disgusts me. I just need my hovel, no!</p><p>I don't even need my hovel! Hell, I just told everyone that I'll camp at the Shed for a third time!</p><p>Everyone is under the impression that if there's not a lot of people in the town that the zed heads will get lazy like us cannibals and won't kill everyone..... Dumb idiots.</p><p>I'm grabbing all kinds of good things like a water pistol and a groundsheet... I'll not only survive, I'll survive in style!</p><p>I found a gun a couple of days ago, locked my house to keep the old relic of the world beyond safe... If only I had a handful of bullets! Then I'd be able to shoot <em><span class="tid_strike">everyone of these stupid idiots in the town</span></em> a handful of zeds.... Teach them a good lesson like I always do...</p><p>Heh...</p><p>I'm leaving now, I hope someone <em><span class="tid_strike">sets themselves on fire and runs around for my amusement</span></em> finds this stupid thing. It's a good waste of time I guess....</p><p>Well, I'm leaving now. I'm most likely going to write another entry in this damn thing because I'll survive tonight unlike all these idiots!</p><p>~DrJamez, the puppet master<br>P.S: I'm NoT cRaZy!!!!<br><em>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</em></p>

I... no, I’m not, am I.<br>I appear to have given up the ghost, so to speak. I am now a spirit, incorporeal, sitting above my own body.<br>I was devoured by 21 zombies, apparently.</p><p>My notebook and pen seem to have made the transition with me, so I will keep writing this diary. I was not the only one to die in the attack. <strong>IceKunni, Ipod732, ishimu, KillSkill, KittyKatz, Kollin, Linktt, LLIBED, Luchogia, Lyner, mamenity, Prolapse, tasd</strong>, and myself all were eaten. <strong>fdamned26</strong>, as he promised, committed suicide. <br>As a side note, the meaty bones themselves also claimed one victim: <strong>Kimbold</strong>, who died of an infection.<br>11 people remain alive now: AmanRawr, AnachroNia, Dath, DrJamez, FoxMcCloud, GabitzBoy, lp91, omnifire, ReplaY021, taylork2, and ZoeBrooke.</p><p>Outside the house, the ghosts of the other citizens are waiting. MayorGriffonn is here! I knew he had not deserted this town. And next to him, there is the biggest spectral Crow I have ever seen. This explains who kept delivering the newspaper every day when I was alive.<br>The Crow’s not bad conversation, either.</p><p>I am able to cross the desert by merely thinking now. I have taken a look at the other surviving towns, in person.<br><strong>Roads of Sand</strong> and <strong>Insanitary Bay of Cyclops</strong> both had their gates torn off in the midnight attack. 6 survivors are left, all camping in scattered tents in the wastelands. <br>Amazingly, <strong>Taciturn Lakes of Thirst</strong> appears to be going strong. Their town is more like a fort, and they have 23 citizens still living.<br>The <strong>Outdated Port</strong> is slowly losing people, and there will be more tonight, depending on how many zombies come at them and how many survivors camp. And <strong>The Hospital of Bees</strong> is still out of water. Many of the ghosts of other towns have moved on already; all of our own are still here.</p><p>Back at home— what the?!<br>It appears that some vandal has found my diary and is writing in it! The bigger problem is, the vandal is DrJamez. I never realized he was so... off-kilter. I’ll keep writing in between his entries, and see what he thinks of THAT!</p><p>It’s getting harder to see the town, now. <strong>AnachroNia</strong> and <strong>DrJamez</strong> are going camping in the desert. <strong>AmanRawr, Dath, FoxMcCloud, GabitzBoy, lp91, omnifire, ReplaY021, taylork2</strong>, and <strong>ZoeBrooke</strong> are hunkering down and praying they see another day.<br>Me and MayorGriffonn are watching them, anxiously. How many will live tonight?<br><em>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</em></p>

Their days are numbered, too.</p><p>I’m still getting those strange dreams. This latest was of another land entirely! It was populated by this strange creatures... some looked like electrified cats, while others were too wooly to see <em>what</em> they looked like underneath. Still others were animate stone statues. Humans befriended these creatures, traveling around the land.</p><p>When I saw them, three of these animals were fighting a dragon! The battle raged back and forth, with the dragon blowing flame, one of the animals (a sea-creature) spitting back water, and two others falling back to heal themselves.<br>I returned to consciousness before I could see the outcome.</p><p>The Crow is slowly forming all the ghosts into a band, like our original band of survivors, and a ghostly wind is starting to blow. It has told me that we must soon follow this wind. I have asked the Crow for a delay: I must finish this chronicle of our town.</p><p>It says there is no rush.</p><p><em>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</em></p>

The shade of <strong>AnachroNia</strong> joined us, as last night’s zombie horde scoured the desert for fresh victims. DrJamez’s and my games are a huge success. Almost all of the other residents play them now, especially ‘Mini Troopers’.</p><p>The wind has increased to full strength, and our band is all together once again. All 40 of us feel the urge to move, and the Crow has just flapped his wings and begun to fly towards the light.</p><p>It’s almost time for me to finish this chronicle, as we are picking up speed. I have asked the Crow about this place we are going to, what it is.<br>In a sepulchral voice, he croaked, “A better world. CrooooOOOAAAAAAAWWWWWW!!”</p><p>That’s it, then. The town is just now flashing underneath. I will leave this journal behind...</p><p>and journey to a better world.<br><em>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</em></p><p><strong><em>THE END.</em></strong></p><p>So, what did you think?</p>

Unless a hero donates days, I think many people here will join a contest just because they can! Creativity should rule!</p><p>Time for residents to hold zero cost contests!</p>
