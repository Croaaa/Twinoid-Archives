                <p>Hello everyone, I open this subject because in the MyHordes project, we try to be as faithfully as possible of the 4 versions of the game Hordes / Die2Nite / Die Verdammten and Zombinoia. For those who do not know what MyHordes is, I refer you <a target="_blank" href="http://twd.io/e/Nrjn0M/0">to this thread (in english)</a>.</p><p>Among the various functions of the game, there is the <strong>Night mode</strong>. I remind you how the Night mode works, which only exists in Hordes.fr and <em>(apparenlty)</em> in Zombinoia.com :</p><p><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"> Allows theft of objects in the Bank (33% chance of not being spotted). It doesn't gives a "Theft" pictogram.<br><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"> Increase the chances of survival when digging your grave during this interval (equivalent to 2 camp improvements)<br><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"> Provides a bonus for scout camouflage <em>(lack of accurate data)</em><br><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"> Reduces the chances of finding an object from 19:00 to 7:00 game time by 20-33%, but penalty eliminated if a bedside lamp / torch or Novelty Torch is placed on the ground</p><p>There is a disagreement regarding the implementation of night mode in the community. For the French, it's obvious (<a target="_blank" href="http://twd.io/e/YYHm0M/1">french poll result here</a>).<br>An overwhelming majority of the french community consider that night mode is compulsory in MyHordes; and for good reason, it is part of the habits of the server.<br>But some players from other communities do not want it added to MyHordes, for several reasons, in particular related to the time difference of communities spread across the world and players who are restricted in their game during French night hours, being at a permanent disadvantage. At the level of the English organized towns, it is also an addition which, according to them, would allow the French to keep all their strategies when they should review them from scratch to take it into account, and therefore an advantage for the French server.<br>The reasons are multiple, some players simply do not like this mechanism, and to try not to lose any player it is necessary to find a compromise solution.</p><p>Here are the 3 solutions that have been thought of so far; do not hesitate to discuss it on the subject:</p><br><p><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_arrow.gif" alt=":hordes_fleche:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Possible solution #1</strong> : We add the night mode as is, but we may lose some of the other players who are really against it. This solution is the simplest, but goes against the idea of losing as few players as possible.</p><br><br><p><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_arrow.gif" alt=":hordes_fleche:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Possible solution #2</strong> : We are adding the night mode as is but we are also adding a new construction which depends on the Lighthouse and which would be unlockable with a common plan, <strong>Public lighting</strong> or <strong>Novelty street lamp</strong> (name to discuss). It would be upgradable like this:<br>- lvl0 : the night penalty is removed 2km from the city<br>- lvl1 : the night penalty is removed 6km from the city + consumes one battery per day <em>(like the Water Turrents) and does not work if no battery in the bank</em><br>- lvl2 : the night penalty is removed 10km from the city + consumes one battery per day <em>(same)</em><br>- lvl3 : the night penalty is removed on the whole map + consumes 2 batteries per day <em>(same)</em><br>- lvl4 : there is a bonus to night searches of 20% + consumes 2 batteries per day <em>(same)</em></p><p>This solution allows to keep the night mode, and the usual functions to get rid of it <em>(bedside lamp / torch / Novelty Torch)</em> while providing a new alternative which can even lead to discussions and new strategies for organized towns; without impacting the random game:</p><p>- as it depends on the Lighthouse and the opening of a plan, it does not impact random cities by adding a new site that is useless for them<br>- for organized towns it adds a voting option, and therefore a strategy option (where to place it? is it profitable compared to sending Novelty Torch with the expeditions? battery consumption? ...)<br>- 4 votes to arrive at a search bonus is 4 votes lost for other things; defense, water, PA in the workshop, ...<br>- allows to leave the penalty at night for all, but gives an option to remove it without the use of objects; less profitable among the English because of their individual experiences with zoo<br>- still consumes batteries like the daily use of a lamp; new evolution going in the direction of Water Turrents</p><br><br><p><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_arrow.gif" alt=":hordes_fleche:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Possible solution #3</strong> : Another solution would be to activate the night mode only for French cities (because on MH, cities have their language). That would suit everyone: the French will have night mode and the English players will not. The problem with this solution is that we intend to make a classification of all the cities in common, and therefore to do that it is necessary that all the cities have the same rules, otherwise it would unbalance the classification. And then if we do that, it's also simple for a French player who doesn't like the night mode to go to an English city, and that's not the basic intention because we have only one server and not 4. Even Brainbox (the main developer of MyHordes) does not like this solution.</p><p>In any case, we will lose players. "The trick" is to try to lose the least <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Consequently, I let you indicate in the commentary of this topic which solution seems to you the most interesting; and if you have other ideas do not hesitate to let us know</strong></p>

                <p>Hello !</p><p>I'm a French Oracle, I was in charge to discuss with the devs before the updates of the game.</p><p>The second solution is my proposal, I think it's the best compromise for both communities, with a minimum of impact in the casual cities.<br>The site can be developed and adjusted of course. The different percentages are there in an indicative way : we can do it with 3 levels in place of 4, or with a larger bonus for the last level, or with different distances,...</p><p>The balance can be made in a second time, the important thing is to have a global idea and a direction to work and think about it. So I look forward to hearing your feedback on the subject, and see if the solution seems like a good option to work on.</p>

I can go double check if necessary. All I know is there was indeed more distinctions being awarded than there should be in that season. There are multiple forum threads covering this and the math checks out.</p><p>But I agree, there's way too much stuff to fix before importing things in the new game. I'd do whatever is easier for the already overburdened devs, even if it means start things anew and have just a "old soul" thingie where you can see what you did at die2nite, the towns you played, etc.. Maybe this is the optimal as some players here have souls in more than one version and they might want to keep their hard earned pictos too.</p><p>As for Night Mode: I'm also voting for option 1 as it is the easier to implement and we can just adapt to it. That or have different leaderboards for each type of town as we have here and try having each server as they are. Useless Laser diodes and all &lt;3</p>

                <p>first i must point out that the english server have had the night penalty for few weeks when MT implemented it for all servers , also some experienced it in UFC i think (idk Season 9 or so), but then we requested its removal because it simply caused tuns of complications and unfairness... thats in the past tho, the dark Ages... BUT we did experience it already, its not new, nothing special. just a huge pain and handicapping for international players... lots and lots of empty searches and lots and lots of online log in times required to adapt to it...</p><br><p>not sure the main point about the laser Pointer got across clearly from above so i will point it out in details:<br>if english server is to get night penalty , we automatically get the novelty torch with it , and with it we can build the laser pointer which is a very overpowered item to have, 8 guaranteed kills with 1 battery, makes building even the chainsaw or mk2 useless. with it the game becomes too easy , less motivating due to lack of struggle killing zombies. zooing becomes too easy even in HC maps regardless if its needed or nonsense strategy. <br>all that changes the game dramatically to the point that it wont be the same game english player base have experienced in past 5 to 7 years. <br>so yet again hordes players bigger player base calls the shots... nothing changes in that matter... i miss epoq/Buzzard. they used to say that everything is going to be OK, dont worry , i wont let the french do this to you guys! and then few days later they get Fired nor reassigned <img src="../../../../gfx/square/surprised.png" alt="8D" class="tid_ico"><br><span class="tid_wspoil">that was a joke , i love french fries</span></p><p>about #3, as usual the obvious option is the hardest to do...<br><cite>if we do that, it's also simple for a French player who doesn't like the night mode to go to an English city, and that's not the basic intention because we have only one server and not 4. Even Brainbox (the main developer of MyHordes) does not like this solution.</cite></p><p>i dont see why this is a problem for anti-night-mode french players to move to an english town! its their choice completely. <br>they get the luxury of choosing with which mode to play if they can speak english (most can). it will not harm the english towns much if at all.<br>so why avoid mixing those 4 communities by personal choice if they all can speak english/french/german/spanish? obviously you will have a simple rule of speaking only the language of each town you join.</p><p>of course i get that programming #3 is going to be more complicated and a huge pain because its just 1 server for 4 languages, but thats the whole idea of saving the game. <br><span class="tid_wspoil">a bit of a sarcastic joke at the end <br><br>if it were easy , MT would have open sourced it...</span> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":sq_happy:" class="tid_ico"> <br>ops, i went there...</p>

                <p>Hey <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I read some of the opinions. Didn't see the following topic brought up.</p><p>Back in the old days (Season 8-9) most of us were in school/university and had a lot of free time to log in and play.</p><p>Now we are older and most of us have real life things to do(home, work, kids, etc.). I'm one of these cases. I don't have the luxury to log in the morning, before i go to work and send my player out searching.</p><p>Unfortunately i can't sneak some MyHorde time while at work, so my only option is to play at night. This puts me in a disadvantage, even if my timezone is 1 hour ahead of server.</p><p>But what about the USA/Canada players (if he have such)? They are at least 6 hours (East coast to GMT+1) behind server time. Which means that at 7:00 server time, when the night mode ends it's 1:00 in the morning there. Half of the game day is lost.</p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay"><img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":sq_smile:" class="tid_ico"></span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay"><strong>I vote for option 3- keep them separate.</strong></span></span></p>

                <p>this specific mode which MT implemented to the game later in season 9 is simply not for everyone all around the world, therefore to keep everyone happy it needs to be dropped all together IF the goal is to keep all players playing After/IF MT shuts down their server.</p><p>those who want night mode are not in any way at disadvantage or advantage , thy can play the game with or without the night mode. they played it for years and the game was as attractive then as it is now for them/all 4 servers.<br>however they are a bit greedy deep down wanting the 10% camping bonus and the laser weapon.</p><p>so from my point of view i see it, the night mode fans dont care if a big number of other players quit the game as long they get to enjoy a tiny 10% and an extra weapon out of it. those who like to play with tough hard mode can play HC to satisfy their needs.</p><p><strong>worst case Brainbox and co can implement the 10% camping bonus and allow laser pointer and novelty torch to be built , but turn off the night mode penalty completely as if it does not exist for all 4 language towns.<br></strong></p><p>also there is the possibility that a full 40 player english players could think about playing a french town to rank it even tho non of the 40 speak french just to rank a town in other servers. and the other way around for french playing english towns to rank in the english ranking. same for german and spanish.<br>BUT the second you create a difference between servers that one player base can´t handle , you separate the interactions between players and servers which could turn out to be the most fun of a competition which we never had during MT times except UFC.</p>

                <p>Absolutely, unequivocally, option 3. English towns don't want night mode, we already fought tooth and nail to get it removed. if we could just get laser diode removed too, I'd be happy as heck. I don't mind separate leaderboards and separate modes, let people play what they're used to. the great thing about the English version is all timezones play it and night mode will definitely hurt us.</p>

                <p>LUL maybe it was hidden complaining and not on the forum? I do not remember complaining or night mode introductions at all. If they did change it, it probably wasn't due to the (few?) complaints if it wasn't publicly announced night mode came? MT probably didn't plan for it to be in our server so they took it out, no matter if or if not players complained.</p>

                <p>Mmmmh, I saw all your answers and i can say that : when an update is done it's for all servers, actually Hordes and Zombinoia have the Night Mode, for Die Verdammten apparently they don't have. So if you has the Night Mode before it's not "a mistake" from MT i think.</p><p>One solution proposed by someone was to make cities by time zone, and therefore the attack always takes place at midnight local time and no longer French time. But the concern of this is that for example in America there are 9 time zones, so that would require 9 "American" cities each with a different time zone. The problem with this is that English users are going to spread out and some cities will fill up faster than others (so maybe for some cities, it will take 1 week for get 40 players, and others it will take only one day). We therefore refused this proposal as is</p>

                <p>When I spoke of the attack time with local time, it also implied that from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. local time (in cities with a time zone) the Night Mode is active, and therefore this resolves the concern <em>"errrr the French have an advantage"</em> because in this case, night mode is effectively applied to the "night" of local time and no longer to the "night" of French time.</p><p>But this solution is not too viable with respect to the different time zones in the different countries (I took the example of America, but it is the same if the game would be available in Russian, there is has 11 different time zones in Russia)</p>

But the concern of this is that for example in America there are 9 time zones, so that would require 9 "American" cities each with a different time zone. The problem with this is that English users are going to spread out and some cities will fill up faster than others (so maybe for some cities, it will take 1 week for get 40 players, and others it will take only one day). We therefore refused this proposal as is</p></cite><br><br><br><br><p>What about just using the central most time zone as the base time for each country?</p>

                <p><cite>Another solution would be to activate the night mode only for French cities (because on MH, cities have their language). That would suit everyone: the French will have night mode and the English players will not. The problem with this solution is that we intend to make a classification of all the cities in common, and therefore to do that it is necessary that all the cities have the same rules, otherwise it would unbalance the classification. And then if we do that, it's also simple for a French player who doesn't like the night mode to go to an English city, and that's not the basic intention because we have only one server and not 4. Even Brainbox (the main developer of MyHordes) does not like this solution.</cite></p><p>If you want all cities of all languages to follow the same rules then abandoning night mode entirely should also be a viable option. <br>So far I see "those who didn't have it so far and don't want it have to live with it", "we give those who didn't have it so far and don't want it a resource heavy way out" and "we turn it off for those who didn't have it so far but we really, really don't want that."</p><p>That's a little one sided. "We turn it off for everyone." isn't even part of the discussion.</p>
