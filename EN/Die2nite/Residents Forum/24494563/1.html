                <p>That's fairy tales with a capital Z for Zombies.</p><p>I held a little contest in our town, “The Tombs of Losers”, for who could rewrite a favorite fairy tale and add zombies to it. The best story got a stack of old paper that I found in the desert which they could use to write on and/or as toilet paper. Second Place just got an old Encyclopedia which was already written all over and so was only really useful as TP. Sadly, second place died horribly without the simple pleasure of wiping her arse and it was awarded to the third place entrant.</p><p>Here are the stories in order</p><p>First Place <span class="tid_preRoleplay">Jean-Ralphio</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Little Red Riding Hood</span></span></p><p>Second Place <span class="tid_preRoleplay">Grungie Girl</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">The Girl Who Cried Zombie</span></span></p><p>Third Place <span class="tid_preRoleplay">Graemy P</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Everyman</span></span></p><p>Honorable Mention <span class="tid_preRoleplay">Bonnie Parker</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Snow White</span></span></p><br><p>Please, I encourage you all to write your own Fairy TaleZ and add them to this collection.</p>

In my earlier days, when my heart thrusted blood through my veins, there were those who claimed Life after death was the ultimate goal of life. That we would be awarded for our deeds during life, that we would live in Paradise with He who created us. <br>Perhaps I did not die in the correct fashion. No, perhaps He who created us has a twisted sense of humor and while blood no longer flows through my body my muscles still somehow stir, twitch and flex.<br>It had been years, decades perhaps since i had tasted the sweet protein of living brains. <br>But there, before my lifeless eyes a young living girl skipped through my dead forest. <br>She was young and her blood was thin, healthy, i could hear it in her voice as she hummed through the forest. Her head clad in a crimson cowl with a cape flowing behind her in a ruby tide of fabric. <br>My body is all but dry yet somehow I managed to produce saliva easily imagining her head covered in a different red fluid. <br>"Yessssssssss" I hissed through my teeth my heart still, it is always still. <br>Immediately i consider the chase, she would not be hard to out-run for I do not tire and she is unarmed and weak. <br>But though my heart may not function my brain works in my undead state. "The young one must have a destination, a reason to stroll in my wood" I thought silently to myself as she frolicked by, oblivious to me in the thick plant. She could lead me to more food. She WOULD lead me to more food. I watched her pass obliviously, completely unaware of the filthy end she would soon endure. A smile across my broken face, long since missing cheeks you would not know the difference but I could feel the satisfaction in my choice. I shambled ahead, knowing she would hear the disturbance but moving too fast for her to know what caused it. <br>In my life so long ago I was a hunter, it's amazing how those skills come back to the dead when they are needed. The dead muscles do not forget. She, of course was not trying to hide her direction which made her destination far too easy to discern. <br>Perhaps an hour of scouting ahead I found her likely point of interest. An Old house, no a shack really, how had I never seen it in my years in the forest? My eyelid blinked, my other eye long dried out and dysfunctional. Never before had I noted any life here. Some sign of activity would have been noticed.</p>

                <p>The Huntress part I</p><p>I am not prey.<br>I am not a fucking victim.<br>And if you think I am afraid then I have already beaten you. <br>This wood was once full of the dead, we have picked them off one at a time for at least a decade. They are like fingers, individually they are nothing but formed together they make a weapon, a blunt force to be reckoned with.<br>I am not prey. <br>I am a warrior, a protector, a knife in a boot. I am not the first to go for a stroll and probably will not be the last. <br>I am not prey. <br>I am not the cheese on the trap, I am the cold steel that breaks the rat’s neck. <br>The dead are difficult to hunt, they are masters of disguise whether intentional or not, they make no sound until it is too late and they are motionless until they are ready to feed. <br>I will don my red cap with the flowing cape of silk. And as I was trained, as dozens were trained before me I will temp the dead into a feeding frenzy.<br>Taking a deep breath and shedding the last of my fears in the village, I take a step into the wood with nothing but a satchel with a crude battery launcher and three batteries. I will not use it, I will use my hand made blades hidden on my person but one cannot be too careful.<br>"I am not prey" I close my eyes and whisper the words of our town. Then newly determined I paint an innocent smile of my face and relax my muscles so they do not betray my nerves and I skip through the wood without a care.<br>It didn't take long for me to find signs of the dead. <br>A tree with broken branches just above foot level is a good hint, but a rotted toe underneath it is a dead giveaway. My trained eyes spotted the disembodied toe as I skipped past, my hands patted my trusted blade knowing a confrontation could erupt in a moment’s notice. Once the dead eyes spotted me in my bright red train it would only be seconds before its broken hands would be upon its prey.<br>But, I am no prey!<br>Not two minutes after the first sign did I see those same dead eyes I had been waiting for, well hidden behind the brush. I did not stop, I did not pause for a moment but immediately i was confused. The living brain works on electrical pulses, sending information every which-way through synapse's and cortex's, I have no idea how the dead brain works. It was like those pulses stopped in an instant because everything I knew to happen was not happening.<br>The Dead should not be hiding in cover! The dead should not be watching for so long, the dead should be bolting at me like a hungry dog. I slowed my skip down just a fraction of a beat and whistled just a fraction louder. <br>There was no mistake he saw me, he knew I was here skipping past him, perhaps he was not one of the dead. But why would he not call out as I am clearly a living. Why indeed.<br>Then as i was about to stop to call out to the living hiding in the brush, He bolted, faster than any fawn i have yet to see, bolted from his sanctuary and I saw to my genuine horror that this was in fact the dead. My blood ran cold and doubt decided that my system of synapses and cortex's was the perfect place for her to live. <br>I am not prey. <br>That’s what our town’s motto is. I am not prey. <br>I stopped skipping. Which was my first mistake, I didn't know it then but it was. I decided then to creep, to listen to every noise to be one with the living forest. I took out my battery launcher, the very weapon I would not need and held it against my cheek limited my field of vision but ensuring I would not miss.<br>Then I stopped moving all together when i saw it. My mouth hanging by its skin and my brow furrowed in confusion.<br>A house.<br>Like one of old. <br>A house. No scout had ever mentioned a house out here, and in this perfect condition. <br>A house?<br>Reality snapped back into my consciousness like a stressed band when i heard the door creak on its old hinges, I dived into the bush without investigating: my third mistake in an hour. My home-made weapon in line with my eyes darting from the door and windows. <br>"grrruuuuuuuuhhhhHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ACHHHHH" it started barely as a whisper coming from within the house as quiet as a heartbeat and ended loud as an eruption of pleasure echoing throughout the forest.<br>The Dead was in the house and did not care if I knew it or not.</p><br><p>I... am... not... prey!</p>

                <p>The Hunter part II</p><p>My most precious possession is my nose. For whatever reason the sense of smell is amplified upon death. The house had the scent of life, however faint, an easy meal.<br>I cannot recall the last time I tasted living human.<br>I could not even remember its taste, other than that I enjoyed it thoroughly.<br>The girl.<br>I had almost forgotten about her, I was certain this was her destination but I had led her by no more than an hour. I should smell her approach. But I didn't, I couldn't, only the scent of easy brains.<br>"braaaaiinnnsss" I slowly allowed my atrophied throat groan. Brains indeed.<br>Slowly, I approached the house as silent as a shade. Every instinct telling me to bolt at the house, every instinct being wrong. I pressed my cold body against the walls and listened.<br>Not a sound, but the smell oh that smell.<br>I stretched up to peek in the window, the blinds were drawn but did not meet the bottom, I could peer through about an inch of glass. And that’s when I saw everything.<br>She was old, to be sure, but not as old as my nose had suggested. Sitting in a chair facing the front door eyes fixed on the old wood. In one hand she held an old jerry can like they used in wars of the living, and in her other hand a hose with her finger on the pressure release. And there she sat, nearly naked in her tattered clothing, as still as gargoyles over an ancient church.<br>It took all my effort not to laugh, although I can't be sure then i can laugh any longer. Her paranoia was well founded but her guile didn't match my own. She was sitting against the back wall with a window not two feet to her left, those shades were drawn just as the window in the front but some rotten fabric wouldn't stop my arm.<br>A new smell, younger and breathing heavily invaded my nostrils. The young one had returned and she was terrified. Perhaps she had seen me! I quickly darted to the back of the house, skin pealing from my back onto the house. <br>I cannot risk the water cannon I must consume her first. Then the defenseless girl will make a fine desert. Or, a devious smile drew on my watering lips as I stood in front of the back window, perhaps a new companion.<br>With a swift punch I thrust my fist through the window, to my surprise there was no glass, it had long ago been broken out, without hesitation I hooked my arm around her neck stopping any flow of air.<br>Her finger pressed the release and the poison water splashed against the door harmless to me. She tried to point the nozzle higher at my arm but the can was not nearly full and that initial spurt was all she had. <br>I let her go.<br>She stood up from the chair as I peeked my grey head in from the open void, her eyes narrow with fear. <br>My lanky body easily climbed through the hole that was once a window and I smirked at how many times luck had been on my side today.<br>"What are you!?!" She whispered in abject fear. <br>I stepped closer to her, backing her against the wall and answered with a low "brraaaiiinnnnsss" She was easy to pin to the wall, my boney fingers against her shoulders as she braced herself for death, accepting her fate.<br>I opened my mouth and pushed my teeth into her head pulling her down slightly and that’s when she realized true horror.<br>I had no interest in killing her.<br>My teeth were old but not brittle as I pushed them down on her skull, lifting my head and tapping again and again attempting to crack her skull, every time a little harder, it wasn't long before I felt warm blood dribble down my chin. My chest was already wet with quiet tears. She squirmed and fought but she was cornered and my hunger was growing with the taste of blood. <br>Finally I could feel her bone chip away and that’s when I went berserk. I pushed her down as her tears turned into hyper ventilation and bit frantically at where she started to lose skull, i pried my fingers into the widening gap and pulled them apart when I could fit them. Hair skin and blood everywhere and then I saw it. Throbbing with blood.<br>Did you know that in a horrible twist of irony the nerve center of every living being has no nerve endings? You cannot feel your brain, I smiled to myself, but you know when it’s being devoured.<br>The brain is always smaller then I think. And somehow I’m always surprised that it only takes maybe five minutes to eat one. Especially when it took at least 20 minutes to get at it.<br>I stood up feeling as close to alive as I can, and let out a groan that matched the pleasure I had felt for the first time in so many years.</p>

                <p>The Huntress part II</p><p>A splash of vibrant red against a canopy of green. <br>It was the worst camouflage. One mistake after another, I thought to myself, surely I will pay for one of these.<br>That groan was unearthly, it turned my bones to ice. The dead did not behave as the dead do. <br>He behaved as we do. <br>But he was most certainly not one of us, he was a monster and must have found something he really liked in that house. <br>My launchers cold metal felt like a blanket against my frozen cheek. I slowly stood up careful not to make a sound. And that's when all my training was forgot.<br>Without the slightest of warnings the houses door exploded open becoming splinters as it hit the side. And standing in the door way he flexed. <br>His skin grey and peeling, one eye dried and useless the other wild and frantic, not an ounce of fat only bone and muscle under his rotting skin. I have seen dozens of the dead but I have never seen one with muscle tissue that pulsed with 'life'. His chin dripped with fresh blood.<br>He had just fed. <br>I am not prey.<br>I sneered as the cold in my bones turned white hot with adrenaline and raised my launcher to the monster. <br>"DIE MOTHER FUCKER!" I fired my weapon at his head. It was like time slowed down just for us as I saw surprise on the dead's ugly face as if an attack was the last thing he expected. The Battery ripped through his shoulder slowly and was lodged half way out. <br>Reality sped toward my consciousness like a rabbit fleeing from a wolf. I had missed.<br>"ughhhnnnn" He clutched his disabled arm still hanging by shredded skin, the bone disconnected with a battery. All the horrors I have seen my young life could not prepare me for the atrocity I witnessed as the dead tore his own arm from its socket, the battery falling to the wooden floor. <br>For the first time he acted as the dead should act as he burst at me with surprising speed, but he held his arm like a weapon, none of my teachers ever mentioned the dead using tools or weapons. But it mattered not…<br>Because I am not prey.<br>I lifted the launcher over my head and threw it as hard as I could at the beast. Slapping hard against his chest knocking him back. With bloodlust he hurled his own disembodied arm at me and struck me against my neck. It was heavier than I thought and cold with oil. <br>But I could not recoil, for to falter would be death. I jumped to my feet, my crimson cloak waved behind me as I clutched the hidden blades within my belt; 18 inches of death between the two of them. Only a beheading would end this.<br>I am not prey.<br>He was not to be made prey either it seemed. Not bothering to lift himself to his feet he scrambled on all three limbs towards me, his mouth wide and red, steam coming from his mouth as rain began to fall. Unfortunately not hard enough to hurt my opponent but enough to sizzle on contact. <br>All the better, my blades where thirsty as I lunged at him and slashed at his head.<br>My momentum was redirected at the last moment by the sudden grip of his lost arm on my ankle. Still alive it tripped and spun me a complete 180 degrees. I fell on my ass right in front of him, my head like a parfait before his teeth. What had happened, I thought as moving like the fastest of the living and he was on me. I felt him pull down my hood. I jerked to get free but he grabbed my shoulder and without hesitation thrust his teeth down on my forehead.<br>"Holy SHIT" Panic gripped my voice as he pounded his teeth down on my brow again. This time blood streamed into my eyes. "No, I AM NOT PREY" And that's when I stretched both arms out with the blades wet with rain. I could hear him slurp my blood from my head and that would be his last taste. <br>He pushed one arm down, but could not counter my left as I thrust the knife into his head.<br>It cut him like cutting a hot carrot, slimy with little resistance. <br>He let me go and squealed louder than any pig. I took advantage of his distraction and scurried away turning myself to face my quarry. <br>The blade was down to the hilt in his temple and he shook violently, but he would not 'die'. <br>Red clouded my vision as blood freely pooled into my eyes stinging them. I untied my hood and wiped my face. And once my face was free I saw the monster grip my blade and pull it up through his skull. <br>I did not know if he could survive such a wound or for how long but I did not want to know what he could do with that blade. <br>Two steps was enough.<br>Two large steps and my blade could pass through the dead's throat. Fresh blood over flowed from the exposed throat and his split head fell to the ground. <br>I was safe and I should be relieved. <br>But I was exhilarated. I howled at the top of my lungs, grabbed the dead’s head and spiked it to the ground. The rain cooling my overheated skin. <br>I bundled the head in my discarded cloak, I would keep it as a trophy. <br>Now I am hungry after a fight like I’ve never had. "I'll just hunt on my way home" I said to no one in particular. The travel was long but glad. All sorts of endorphins filled my blood as it stopped rushing through my veins. Even my head wound stopped flowing as the danger passed. <br>I found it odd how hungry I was but yet how nothing sounded tasty enough to eat. I brought rations but they didn't interest a champion such as myself. Random rabbits didn’t' sound good, even my favorite venison couldn't sate my hunger.<br>I knew I would know what to feed myself when I got to town, all I needed was to sit and request it and the town would supply it.<br>The town.<br>As I neared my home I saw what I truly hungered. Hundreds of them, a meat I have never eaten but now I knew I could not live without. The skin from my head wound was getting between the meat I deserved and my eyes, I reached up and pulled the skin off my head stared at all the residents in the town. My mouth watering and my legs twitching with anticipation.<br>They are my prey.<br>They are MY prey!</p><br><p>Author <span class="tid_user tid_user_3628016 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="3628016">Jean-Ralphio</span></p><p>P.S.

She was bored and wanted to have some fun. So she decided to shout out "Zombie! Zombie! Zombie is getting Thybbie!" A small group of people from the town planned an expedition to rescue Thybbie and kill the Zombie. When the group of people arrived at the zone, they didn't seen the Zombie. The girl smirked while the people were pissed off about wasting Action Points.</p><p>"Don't cry "Zombie, GrungieGirl", said Lodur, Siru-Nyan and goodnames, "when there's no Zombie!" They went, angrily mumbling, back to town. Next day, the girl decided to shout out "Zombie! Zombie! Zombie is getting JustFreeman!" once again. Another small group of people in the town mapped out another expedition to rescue JustFreeman. She watched Lodur, goodnames and Siru-Nyan while they ran through zones to save JustFreeman.</p><p>When they got to the zone, they didn't seen a Zombie. The group told the girl "Save your cries for when there's really a Zombie! Don't cry 'Zombie' when there is NO Zombie!" The girl smirked and watched the people while they angrily mumbled again.</p><p>Next day, she actually saw a real Zombie going after BonnieParker. She posted on the forums shouting "Zombie! Zombie!" The people didn't believed her and thought she was trying to trick them again. And so... they didn't bothered planning an expedition to help rescue BonnieParker. Before the next attack, the people wondered where was the GrungieGirl and BonnieParker. They couldn't do anything as the attack was in about a minute. After the attack, a small group of people went to the zone where the GrungieGirl and BonnieParker were hanging in.</p><p>They noticed Meaty Bones, all over, in the zone. ibisin said "I guess she wasn't lying about the Zombie this time." JustFreeman said "I hate to say this... but that's what she gets for crying Zombie when there wasn't really a Zombie." While the group heads back to town, Lodur said "Nobody believes a liar."</p>

One of them, lucky or quick, ascended<br>a tree, but the other, alone after what his friend did,<br>collapsed on the spot, played possum, became a ball<br>of helpless flesh just trying to be small.<br>The zombie crouched and with an inquiring nose<br>poked at his obstinate bulk while his blood froze.<br>It hesitated, then sensing his life<br>lunged for it’s meal and so ended its strife.<br>A solid branch on the ground where the traveler lay cowering<br>pierced it’s eye and so saved him from most imminent devouring.<br>From the tree “You all right?”. His blood thawed and flowed,<br>still alive the fellow picked himself up from the road.<br>“A hell of a thing,” said the one coming down from the tree.<br>“It was,” said the other. “You know what that zombie said to me?”<br>“It said? It spoke? What did it say to you my friend?”<br>“That my association with you, you no-good-son-of-a-bitch, piss-ass bastard, is at an end!”</p>

                <p>I kinda wish you would of asked for my permission before reposting this for the others to see, to be honest. I have a feeling the story was somewhat changed up on me. :x Though, I can't look at it as I died young. <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Grungie I was just trying to get the stories out of town before I died. I did make a few minor changes to the text that seemed to be mistakes made from using the random name thing. For instance there were several notations saying "this will be person 1" that had nothing to do with the story. Other than that i changed the last victim to Bonnie because you had the victim on the rescue team. I also changed the opening from "a resident girl" to "a Grungie resident girl" since you were the protagonist throughout. Other than that I left all of it as written, even odd turns of phrase because I didn't want to mess with your style.</p><p>The stories were already publicly posted, so reposting and linking is something that is just done these days as long as credit for the work is given to the author. Especially when the stories were entered in a contest with prizes. Sorry if it upset you though. Your story was just so good I wanted to make sure it was saved.</p><p>However the town is still alive ( just barely) so you can ask someone to send you the original if you're fast. Go ahead and post that if you prefer it, or make your own edit and post.</p>
