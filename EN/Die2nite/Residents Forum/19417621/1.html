                <p>Just for fun!</p><p>The room was dark and filled with shadows. In the deepest shadow in the furtherest corner, behind the Christmas tree, 2 children sat huddled.</p><p>The little boy whispered to the girl “I don’t think Santa is coming this year”<br>His sister whispered back fiercely “Of course he is!!!! He comes every year!”</p><p>They sat there quietly for a few more minutes.</p><p>The boy whispered again “What if we have been too bad? You know mama said if we were too bad Santa wasn’t going to come”<br>His 4 y/o sister reached for his 6 y/o hand and squeezed lightly. “We’ve been good most of the time. That counts” she said with an emphatic nod of her head.</p><p>The candles on the mantle flickered and the 2 children huddled closer.</p><p>This wasn’t the first year they had tried to wait up for Santa. But in past years it was in warm beds. With heavy eyes. When they had begged to be allowed to stay up, their parents had said, “Of course you can! As long as you stay in bed with your eyes and mouths closed you can wait up all night.” Of course lying in a warm bed unable to speak and keeping your eyes closed led to quick slumber.</p><p>This year was different. They were waiting for Santa in the living room partially hidden behind the tree.</p><p>Their tummies growled at almost the same time. They looked at each other and giggled. They had not eaten since dinner and it was now almost midnight.</p><p>All of a sudden they heard a noise on the roof above their heads. The looked up with excitement. They heard what could only be the stamping of reindeer hooves and the huffing of air that the deer were exhaling. <br>They looked at each other with shining eyes. SANTA!</p><p>They tracked the footsteps on the roof…..their eyes following the sound to the chimney.<br>They heard Santa grunt as he stepped over the lip of the bricked chimney and with a whoosh they heard him in the fireplace itself.</p><p>The excitement was almost too much and the lil girl almost squealed in anticipation. <br>Her brother slapped his hand over her mouth JUST in time.</p><p>By peeking through the branches of the tree they caught glimpses of his red suit. He was just as plump as all the books said he was! He was humming and seemed rather jolly. He had a huge bag with him. He bent over and started riffling through it.</p><p>The 2 children used that opportunity….while he was practically upside down in his bag to sneak from behind the tree…moving slowly they snuck behind him and grabbed the fireplace poker.<br>While the boy rapped Santa on the head as hard as he could. His little sister couldn’t wait even a minute longer. She sunk her teeth into Santa’s red clad thigh, tearing a chunk of meat off that was too big to even swallow. Santa squealed and thrashed around in the bag. Trying to straighten and pull the bag off of his head and shoulders.</p><p>The reindeer on the rooftop made restless shuffling sounds. Soft sounds of distress?</p><p>The boy thumped the bag about 5 more times. Santa fell quiet.</p><p>With a few more thumps on Santa’s head for good measure…the boy wrapped the large sack around Santa’s head and tied the bag’s rope around Santa’s neck. They tugged the fat man over and his belly….well, jiggled like a bowlful of jelly.</p><p>Over the body of Santa the 2 children smiled happily at each other.</p><p>It had been 9 days since their parents had died. With their last coherent thoughts they had tried to protect their children. Before the final death took them they had boarded the house up from the inside. Making a prison out of their once happy home. Sentencing their children to death with them. To a slow painful death. Being young zombies…they had outlived their parents expectations. The adults had thought the children would die with them. The children were the ones that decided to live off the bounty the parents had left them. The children had portioned the bodies of their parents out as long as they could.</p><p>And when food became scarce….they waited for Santa. <br>Just like every year, they knew he would visit. And bring them a gift.</p><p>They begin to eat.</p><p>Edit: Most children believe in Santa. Don't they?</p>

                <p><strong>Day 16</strong><br><em>The town Shaman told me to relieve my stress by writing down my thoughts at the end of each day. I don't feel particularly calm yet. Maybe it takes time?</em></p><p><strong>Day 17</strong><br><em>I showed what I had wrote yesterday to the Shaman and he told me it was a good start, but I should write more how I feel and any actions I have done throughout the day. I worked today on the wall by using some spare wood to plug up any of the holes. There was a loud argument in the town's square too. They yelled about how they had found a dead body and spoke of a ghoul. I do hope we don't really have a ghoul running amok...</em></p><p><strong>Day 19</strong><br><em>I couldn't find time to write yesterday. We found out we had a ghoul and who it was, but he had fled into the desert. I was sent with a search party to find him. We did eventually find him, but when we got there he was face-down in the sand, dead, with his liver removed. No one could figure what had happened to him. The Shaman, however, said it had been The Crow.</em></p><p><strong>Day 20</strong><br><em>Things are getting more and more hectic. The walls waned and swayed purely from the might of the horde last night. The attacks are growing evermore fierce. The town leader is scrambling people to be watchmen for the next few days. Hopefully it will be over soon.</em></p><p><strong>Day 21</strong><br><em>I got drafted for watchmen today. The attack has also spiked to bone-crackling numbers. After a quick run through of our weapons, we're low on weapons and defenses. I fear tonight is my last night. The moon sure looks pretty tonight though.</em></p><p><strong>Day 22 - December 25th</strong><br><em>It is still the 24th, but that shall change in a mere matter of minutes. I was just greeted by a child. A small little boy whom I yelled at for being in such a dangerous place at the more horrific of times. His eyes watered, but then from behind his back he showed me his teddy bear. It was sand-worn and torn from much play, but I stopped yelling the instant I saw it's beauty.<br>He told me, "Merry Christmas, sir."<br>I grabbed him and hugged him tightly. Suddenly, loud howls and groans came riding through the wind, ruffling the sand. The hour has struck midnight and I must finish this entry quickly for they are only several meters from the wall. </em></p>

                <p>Alright, here goes <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_blink.gif" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Christmas Night</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Lucia looked out the window sadly, then calmly boarded it up. The hammer she used was too big for her small eleven year old body. Her younger brother Timmy silently walked over. "What are you doing, Lucy?" he asked.<br><br>"Shhh..." Lucia replied. She looked out into the deserted town. All the adults were on the wall, preparing for the attack that night. Lucia would go out to help, but she had to take care of Timmy, as her mother had patiently explained. Lucia suspected that she just wanted her out of the way.<br>Lucia sighed and continued to board up the window. The sounds of the hammer echoed throughout the house. Bang, bang, bang.<br>The windows finished, Lucia walked to the door and started boarding that up.<br><br>Today was the first day the zombies would get through their extensive defenses. Everyone was called up to the wall; carrying torches, knives, anything. Everyone, except her. <br>After finishing her work, Lucia settled down to wait. Timmy walked over and looked at her. "When is Mom and Dad coming home?"<br><br>Lucia stayed silent.<br>Timmy's voice rose high in panic. "Mom and Dad ARE coming home, right? Right? They are, right?" <br>Lucia lifted her head up sharply, then her face softened. "It's okay, Timmy. Everything is going to be okay."<br>The clock chimed midnight. A heavy silence fell onto the town like the first snow of the year.<br><br>Then, the moans. Impossibly loud. Lucia thought of the townspeople: Uncle Ralph who would strum his out-of-tune ukulele; Miss Mary who sneaked candy to them; her parents who really just wanted them to grow up right. They all were watching, waiting on the wall. Courageously defending the town from the advancing horde.<br><br>Lucia shut her eyes tight. Timmy, concerned, laid a hand on his sister's shoulder.<br><br>Then the screams began. Lucia jumped up and ran to the window. But it was covered with hastily hammered plywood, and impossible to see through. She sank onto the ground. "Please... please..." she whispered. "Let Mom and Dad be okay. I'll listen to them from now on... I'll stay home... I'll do anything..."<br>Now it was Timmy's turn to comfort his sister. "Everything is going to be okay. I'll protect you."<br><br>Lucia looked into her brother's face. She could tell that he was trying to be brave. She smiled and hugged her brother, hard. "Yes," she said, her voice cracking. "Everything is going to be okay."<br>The screams continued, getting louder and louder. Lucia looked at Timmy's frightened face, and it nearly broke her heart. What kind of world are we in, she thought, to force a five year old child to be this scared?<br><br>The screams stopped. Now there was nothing but the moans. Lucia shivered. The moans grew closer. Lucia knew that her parents were probably dead. She had yelled and raged at them only this morning, screaming that she was old enough to go on the wall. She never told them how much she loved them...<br>The moans now sounded like they were right next to the house. The door started pounding, urgently. Timmy's face lit up. <br>"Is it Mom and Dad?" he asked hopefully. Lucia tried to smile, but her eyes teared up inside. "M..m..maybe," she choked out.<br>Timmy burst out into tears. Lucia hugged her brother tightly, watching and waiting as the door bulged in more... and more. The nails popped out one by one, and the wood creaked and cracked.<br>And the moans... The moans...<br><br>Then, with one final crack, the door burst open. Lucia squeezed her eyes shut, waiting for the undead to attack her and eat her piece by piece. She thought of her life... The time she saw her first zombie, safe behind the gates with her parents... Helping to gather twigs, then logs, for the defenses... Sitting with Timmy, watching him grow up... The days passing and passing by. Day by day, year by year. She was relatively safe, she was relatively happy... Surrounded by people who cared about her. <br><br>But that was all going to end very, very soon. Zombie teeth sinking into her arms, her legs. Ripping her apart. Perhaps Mom, Dad, or Uncle Ralph would be among them...<br>To her surprise, no teeth, no hands grabbing, no undead came to eat them both. Lucia opened her eyes cautiously. She gasped in surprise.<br><br>A fat old man was standing in the doorway, blocking the zombies' path. He had a tattered old red suit on, and a worn red hat. He had a fluffy white beard with bits of leaf and dirt stuck inside.<br><br>It was Santa.<br><br>"Ho ho ho," he said, rather strained. "Merry Christmas... Oof!" A zombie knocked into him from the left. Curiously, they didn't try to bite and eat him. Instead, it was as if he was just another obstacle, another barrier between them and the tasty children.<br>Santa looked back at the wide eyed children. "This wouldn't work," he said. "I can't keep this up forever... Time for Plan B!"<br><br>Santa turned around to face the advancing horde. He grabbed the black bag slung over his shoulder and started taking things out and flinging them at the zombies. Toy cars, planes, and stuffed animals flew out of the bag. The zombies seemed to flinch away.<br><br>"Take this, you monsters!" Santa growled. "Childhood... Love... Innocence! Don't you dare steal from MY children!"<br>Santa chucked all sorts of toys at the zombies. The zombies fell, one by one, until there were only a few left. Santa dug deep into the bag and pulled out a machete. Lucia stared. It was the kind she'd always wanted. <br>Without hesitation, Santa swung the machete at the zombies, cutting a wide swath through them. <br><br>Then, Santa reached into his big black bag for the last item inside: a large, fluffy teddy bear. <br>"Ha! Ha! Ho! Ho!" Santa cried as he flung the teddy bear at the last zombies. Unexpectedly, the teddy bear burst into flames in mid air, burning the remaining zombies into a crisp.<br>Timmy walked up to Santa and tugged on his arm slowly. "Are you... Real?" he asked shyly.<br><br>"Oh of course I am," Santa chuckled. Then his face turned serious. "Well, your gifts got destroyed when I fought the zombies... I hope you don't mind."<br>Lucia stood up, emotions swirling around her. She was alive, and so was Timmy! Hanging from death by a thread, then being rescued by Santa. Santa, of all people!<br><br>Lucia blinked, dazed. "That's... alright," she told Santa. "You've given us the best gift there is. I have my brother with me, and I have my life. But most of all, you've given us hope. Thank you."<br>Santa's eyes crinkled at the corners as he smiled. "You're welcome," he said. "That's what I'm here for." <br><br>He winked, then walked outside and was gone. Lucia ran to the door, but didn't see anything except the silhouette of reindeer and a sleigh, outlined against the moon. <br>Timmy joined his sister. "You know," he said, looking up at her. "I always thought Santa wasn't real."<br>"Well, he is," Lucia answered. "He is, and he is a creator of miracles. Merry Christmas, Timmy. I'm so glad you're here."<br></span></span></p>

The hammer she used was too big for her small eleven year old body. Her younger brother Timmy silently walked over. "What are you doing, Lucy?" he asked.<br><br>"Shhh..." Lucia replied. She looked out into the deserted town. All the adults were on the wall, preparing for the attack that night. Lucia would go out to help, but she had to take care of Timmy, as her mother had patiently explained. Lucia suspected that she just wanted her out of the way.<br>Lucia sighed and continued to board up the window. The sounds of the hammer echoed throughout the house. Bang, bang, bang.<br>The windows finished, Lucia walked to the door and started boarding that up.<br><br>Today was the first day the zombies would get through their extensive defenses. Everyone was called up to the wall; carrying torches, knives, anything. Everyone, except her. <br>After finishing her work, Lucia settled down to wait. Timmy walked over and looked at her. "When is Mom and Dad coming home?"<br><br>Lucia stayed silent.<br>Timmy's voice rose high in panic. "Mom and Dad ARE coming home, right? Right? They are, right?" <br>Lucia lifted her head up sharply, then her face softened. "It's okay, Timmy. Everything is going to be okay."<br>The clock chimed midnight. A heavy silence fell onto the town like the first snow of the year.<br><br>Then, the moans. Impossibly loud. Lucia thought of the townspeople: Uncle Ralph who would strum his out-of-tune ukulele; Miss Mary who sneaked candy to them; her parents who really just wanted them to grow up right. They all were watching, waiting on the wall. Courageously defending the town from the advancing horde.<br><br>Lucia shut her eyes tight. Timmy, concerned, laid a hand on his sister's shoulder.<br><br>Then the screams began. Lucia jumped up and ran to the window. But it was covered with hastily hammered plywood, and impossible to see through. She sank onto the ground. "Please... please..." she whispered. "Let Mom and Dad be okay. I'll listen to them from now on... I'll stay home... I'll do anything..."<br>Now it was Timmy's turn to comfort his sister. "Everything is going to be okay. I'll protect you."<br><br>Lucia looked into her brother's face. She could tell that he was trying to be brave. She smiled and hugged her brother, hard. "Yes," she said, her voice cracking. "Everything is going to be okay."<br>The screams continued, getting louder and louder. Lucia looked at Timmy's frightened face, and it nearly broke her heart. What kind of world are we in, she thought, to force a five year old child to be this scared?<br><br>The screams stopped. Now there was nothing but the moans. Lucia shivered. The moans grew closer. Lucia knew that her parents were probably dead. She had yelled and raged at them only this morning, screaming that she was old enough to go on the wall. She never told them how much she loved them...<br>The moans now sounded like they were right next to the house. The door started pounding, urgently. Timmy's face lit up. <br>"Is it Mom and Dad?" he asked hopefully. Lucia tried to smile, but her eyes teared up inside. "M..m..maybe," she choked out.<br>Timmy burst out into tears. Lucia hugged her brother tightly, watching and waiting as the door bulged in more... and more. The nails popped out one by one, and the wood creaked and cracked.<br>And the moans... The moans...<br><br>Then, with one final crack, the door burst open. Lucia squeezed her eyes shut, waiting for the undead to attack her and eat her piece by piece. She thought of her life... The time she saw her first zombie, safe behind the gates with her parents... Helping to gather twigs, then logs, for the defenses... Sitting with Timmy, watching him grow up... The days passing and passing by. Day by day, year by year. She was relatively safe, she was relatively happy... Surrounded by people who cared about her. <br><br>But that was all going to end very, very soon. Zombie teeth sinking into her arms, her legs. Ripping her apart. Perhaps Mom, Dad, or Uncle Ralph would be among them...<br>To her surprise, no teeth, no hands grabbing, no undead came to eat them both. Lucia opened her eyes cautiously. She gasped in surprise.<br><br>A fat old man was standing in the doorway, blocking the zombies' path. He had a tattered old red suit on, and a worn red hat. He had a fluffy white beard with bits of leaf and dirt stuck inside.<br><br>It was Santa.<br><br>"Ho ho ho," he said, rather strained. "Merry Christmas... Oof!" A zombie knocked into him from the left. Curiously, they didn't try to bite and eat him. Instead, it was as if he was just another obstacle, another barrier between them and the tasty children.<br>Santa looked back at the wide eyed children. "This wouldn't work," he said. "I can't keep this up forever... Time for Plan B!"<br><br>Santa turned around to face the advancing horde. He grabbed the black bag slung over his shoulder and started taking things out and flinging them at the zombies. Toy cars, planes, and stuffed animals flew out of the bag. The zombies seemed to flinch away.<br><br>"Take this, you monsters!" Santa growled. "Childhood... Love... Innocence! Don't you dare steal from MY children!"<br>Santa chucked all sorts of toys at the zombies. The zombies fell, one by one, until there were only a few left. Santa dug deep into the bag and pulled out a machete. Lucia stared. It was the kind she'd always wanted. <br>Without hesitation, Santa swung the machete at the zombies, cutting a wide swath through them. <br><br>Then, Santa reached into his big black bag for the last item inside: a large, fluffy teddy bear. <br>"Ha!

                <p>There are some amazing stories around. Might as well write something of my own:</p><p><em><strong>December 22, 3 days for Christmas<br>North Pole Base, <span class="tid_strike">Gift-Wrapping</span> War Room</strong><br><br>-What's the status report on the preparations?-the Boss asked. He is an old man in a red and white suit with a long white beard. He is always comfortable with this meetings, but that one year, it was all different...<br><br>With C-day nearby, the situation is always tense but, with the new circunstances, things were really chaotic. Many, and i include myself, didn't think we'd be able to make it that year. Even the Boss had his doubts, as he told me, some years after the fact. But now, back to the meeting:<br><br>-Well, sir-answered the First Elf, leader of our small workforce-The situation is a mess all around. The new housing that now covers the target zones is awfully inadecuate for our landing needs, let alone entering. Also, due to the impersonators, many people would attack us on sight if they caught us on the ground. We barely secured the main workshop area after the attacks of the 16th, and it's only working at 70%. But the worst damage sustained was in the takeoff zone and reindeer stables. We lost almost the entire pack after the last incident. Honestly... I don't think we can make our goals this year.<br><br>The Boss raised from his chair and started walking around, he was obviously nervous. He asked:<br>-What about reinforcements? Is there anyone we can call?<br><br>-No one sir-the Second Elf, the communication manager, responded-They all seem to have lost their antenna relays. We don't even know if there is anyone left...<br><br>-What am i going to do know?-the Boss asked- There is no way we can make our deliveries, even if we got a new transport running... There is no time.<br><br>The resignation was an unthinkable alternative, and yet, it appeared to be the only one. After so many years of flawless work, to think that we would fail... But what could we do? We had nothing left.<br><br>-No!-cried out the Third Elf, tool master, and in this days, leader of the defense operations-We can't go down without fighting! There has to be a place where we can get supplies, something to we can use to fight back!<br><br>-There is a place-I answered. As the Sixth Elf, and mapping expert, it was my job to know such things, but i never thought we'd go to that particular place again. <br><br>I displayed a map of Russia on the table and pointed to a place in Siberia, as i said:<br><br>-There was an old Soviet weapons bunker, right here. I remember because we always dropped a little coal there back in the days. As far as we know from our last run, no one knew it was there. We should find it full with old weapons we can take.<br><br>-Are you suggesting we deliver weapons?-the Forth Elf, gift specialist, asked me with a tone of disapproval-You know we have a strong anti weapons policy. We aren't arms dealers!<br><br>Then a large discussion started between us, as some where with me, while others disapproved of the idea of a weapons delivery. In the middle of the screaming, the Boss hitted the table with his fist, and we all stopped arguing and turned towards him as he spoke:<br><br>-We can't deliver weapons-he began, in a tone that allowed no reply- but we can deliver safety, even if only for a while. We will take them, and use them to do all the good we can. Prepare vehicules, strong and fast,, we have global operation to do, and only 3 days left!<br><br>Some thought about replying, i will admit even i had my objections to such a plan. But the Boss was completely confident, and he surely knows how to inspire you.<br><br>We all got down to work. There was lots to be done. But we were elves. If this was even possible, then we would do it.</em></p><br><p>This one is coming in 3 deliveries. Prepare to see ruin exploration and close quarters combat in the next chapter, as they go into an abandoned bunker, looking for presents...</p>

They were thirsty for water, but they had only 10 rations left, and hadn`t found any blueprints for water. Shaman thought, that they should lighten up the mood a little by making "a sandman" from the sand. It was christmas soon afterall. <br><br>The plan was taken into action, and the sandman was ready in the evening. After making it, they went to sleep and the shaman closed the gates.<br><br>Suddenly, in the middle of the night, shaman heard a crow. He went outside and saw the crow sitting on the sandman. But it wasn`t a sandman anymore... It had somehow turned into a Snowman, a talking one no less! <br><br>Shaman decided to show the snowman places, the workshop, the gates, his own and other peoples houses. At the end of the course, he took the snowman to the well.<br><br>Snowman looked deep into the well, wanting to know what was in there. Shaman smiled, took a shovel, and SMACKED the snowman into the well. With a loud SMASH, the snowman had gone to pieces in the bottom of the well.<br><br>The next day, people noticed, that the well had 50 more water rations for them to drink, and they started celebrating. The shaman looked at the smiling crow atop the gates, and smiled back.<br><br>the end </span></span></p>

                <p>I have been VERY Inactive as of lately, and it is great to be back on! I am sad to see that Write2Nite ended so abruptly, but this seems fun, and a great way to re-familiarize myself with the D2N Forum community. Its great to be back!</p><p><em>The man smiled, as this was all a man could ask for in the end of the world.<br><br>His wife sat across from him in their decorated hovel, smiling back at him. He gazed into her unique hazel eyes, and she stared back. <br><br>The man switched gazes to his son, where the boy played with an old rusty truck on the hovel floor. Blurting out distorted truck sounds and imagining the truck was going 100 miles per hour, the man couldn't help but laugh. His son was perfect. This life, also perfect.<br><br>The small brown shrub in the corner of their abode shined bright with neatly lit candles on its strongest of limbs. A few crudely crafted decorations portraying stars and spheres hung from more limbs. Though this was not like Christmas once was, it was as perfect as ever.<br><br>The man heard a large beeping sound, and his gaze was broken with his wife. He looked over at a small stove and saw that the steak his friend had stumbled upon in the wastes was cooked to perfection. He gestured to his wife that he would be back in a moment.<br><br>The man got up, and served the meal as nicely as he could. Christmas day was upon them! He picked his son off of the floor and spun him in the air, the boy now making sounds that resembled that of an air plane. The man sure knew his son loved any transportation contraption from the old world. The man had found the toy truck weeks earlier, and just knew that it was the perfect gift for the upcoming holiday!<br><br>Almost as if they could already taste the juicy meat, the small perfect family folded hands, and quietly said a prayer. They all smiled after "Amen" and began to eat their meal.<br><br>A tasty bite of meat so close to his mouth, the man looked around and saw his wife and son, the two most beautiful and meaningful things in the world to him, so happy. This moment could never end. "Enjoy life to the fullest," his wife would say, "Fly as high as the sky!" This was why, for Christmas, he had spent days in the workshop crafting a beautiful glass bird ornament, with two wings which acted as clips to hold itself on the tree.<br><br>Then, as the man bit his steak, he saw out of his window something he would never have imagined. Snow. Glorious. White. Snow!<br><br>He looked at his family to rejoice with them of the miraculous happening, but noticed they were on the floor. Confused, he looked out the window once more, and the white, beautiful snow slowly became a red haze. The melted snow water droplets on his hovel window transitioned into streaks of carson, and an unmistakable hand print sludged in the red mess, streaking across the wall. Horrified, the man closed his eyes as tight as he could.<br><br>Opening his eyes, the man found himself outside with his family, twirling in the falling snow. His son rolled in the thin layer accumulating on the ground, and he held his wife tightly never wanting to let go. he squeezed his eyes, and held his wife, with the cool white flakes touching him gently.<br><br>Opening his eyes once more, the man found he was lying on his side in the sand, covered with splatters and dots of red substance. With his left eye facing up, he stared at his hovel and the other hovels in the community. He saw his unmistakable window with the hand print, and he saw a mushy grey color in the doorway of his home. Focusing more clearly on the doorway, he noticed they were individual streaks, they were humans. No.<br>They were walkers.<br><br>He tried to scream as loud as he could to tell his family to get out, but he could not move or speak.<br><br>Squeezing his eyes, he did not dare to open. He screamed in his mind, in hatred for these monsters that ravaged the world. He wanted to kick the sand stand up and kill them all, but he felt himself lying, void of movement. <br><br>A flow of calmness came over him, and his eyes opened. The man found himself leaning against his hovel wall, inside, with a car door held against him.<br><br>Looking around, he saw nothing. But details began revealing themselves before his eyes, and soon enough it was all visible to him. The two blood stains on the floor, nothing else left over. The blood streak across the window and wall. Beyond the carson window, smokestacks from the other hovels.<br><br>Crawling with no destination, the man began sobbing.<br><br>Looking up, the man found himself at the foot of the short shrub they called a Christmas tree. Knocked over, it lay on top of a small old box. Sniffling, and still crying, but too dehydrated to produce tears, the man stood the tree up and picked up the small box. Unfolding the top, the man lifted out a small, glass bird. <br><br>His tear stained eyes grew a spark. Slowly, the man lifted the ornament and delicately placed it on the tree.<br><br>"Enjoy life to the fullest," his wife would say, "Fly as high as the sky!"</em></p>

                <p>Continuing, although i fell behind on the dates.</p><p><em><strong>December 23, 2 days for Christmas<br>Siberia, Underground Weapons Storage</strong><br><br>I was asigned to the team that was to gather the weapons, since the whole thing had been my idea. The Third and First elves were with me, while the others stayed preparing vehicules for the deployement. We had taken the first of the new Sledges MKII or "Gift Droppers".<br><br>It was equipped with all of our adapted technology: Candy Dispencers were adapted to fire ice shards as high speed projectiles. We also had the Chimmney-fire extinguisher system put to good use. <br><br>As we arrived however, we realized what would have been pretty obvious to anyone with more experience:<br><br>-The sledge won't fit through that door-dictaminated the Third Elf.<br><br>And so, we were down to our water pistols. Luckily, when it comes to toys, we have always been experts. Our water pistols were high quality (North Pole quality, the best there is), able to get 5 zombies per load. You can still find some of those from before the beggining of zombie invasions.<br><br>So, we went in, through the dark hallways of the bunker.<br><br>-The air could be toxic, ¡everyone masks on!-the First Elf ordered, and we quickly complied.<br><br>Soon we found our first obstacle, a locked door. But it could not withstand the power of the Elven Multitool. The secret of our production speed, the Elven Multitool is worth a full tool belt and a workshop with all it's goodies. It makes a swiss army knife look like a rock.<br><br>The door opened within seconds, and it revealed an empty room with several maps. The location of several other bunkers were marked on them.<br><br>-Jackpot!-i said, looking at them-With this, we'll have equipment for many years!<br><br>Then we heard moans, there were zombies coming. We turned over some tables and got behind them. As the zombies, former soldiers, entered the room, we started shooting. There were 6 zombies. We took them all down without errors, and ended up with 3 rounds each.<br><br>-Let's move on-the Third Elf said, as he jumped past the dissolved remains of the zombies.<br><br>Soon enough, we got to the main storage room. There were huge boxes of weapons and ammo, and many bombs.<br><br>-Wait a second...-i said, doubting-¿How are 3 little Eves suppodsed to carry all of this through the tunnels?<br><br>-No... Idea-the First Elf answered.<br><br>We all sat for a while to think of it, until the Third Elf came up with an idea:<br><br>-Well, the sledge can carry the load, it carry presents for everyone in the world, in the very crowded world before all this happened, too.<br><br>-But, ¿how will we get this on the sledge?-I asked, confused.<br><br>-¿See that roof?-he asked, pointing upwards-We aren't that deep, actually. Only enough not to get spotted from the air. We can blow it open with some of the stuff here.<br><br>-But, this is filled up with explosives!-The First Elf screamed-You'll kill us all!<br><br>-Heck, if i solved the plastic desaster of the '92, then i can get this done-the Third Elf said with determination, as he grabbed some explosives, a detonator, and the Multitool.<br><br>Then, he activated the hook in his multitool and went upwards at full speed. We were worried the roof wouldn't withstand it, but it resisted. He glued the explosives and parachuted downwards safely.<br><br>-No need to show off like that-i told him as he arrived at the floor.<br><br>His only responce was to push the button, and watch as the explosion opened up a big hole.<br><br>-I'll get the sledge-i said, and went out of there.<br><br>And that was how the rest of the day went, as we went through the rest of the bunkers in the maps. If they were so secret that we didn't know of them, there was no way anyone got to loot them, or so we assumed. Our assumptions were proven correct by several big loads of weapons. <br><br>We had what we needed. Now it was just a matter of time, and few preparations.</em></p>

                <p>Sorry I'm late, but it took time and I was stressed for that.</p><p><strong>The Goul Who Stole Christmas</strong></p><p><strong>The Goul Who Stole Christmas</strong></p><p><em>It was Christmas time down in "Dunes Of Scavengers", and all the citizens where getting ready to spread holiday cheer. They all left into the desert to scavenge gifts for their friends and family, cheerily singing songs and spreading the holiday spirit. The town Shaman was a very festive woman, she directed the whole Christmas event! She had been growing a tiny Christmas tree in the vege-plot, using several powerful souls to keep it alive through the harsh heat. It was only about 2 feet tall, but she planned on using all the souls she had collected on growing the tree to full height tonight. Tears swelled behind her masked eyes, this would be the best Christmas ever.<br><br>Out in the wastes, laying deep in the darkness of a forgotten ruin, prowled the forgotten. He once was a citizen of the "Dunes of Scavengers", but after eating a foul melon he had been banished by his friends. He had grown pale and weak and his brothers and sisters had feared what he was transforming into. The town Shaman tried to use her healing hands, but to no avail. They had locked him away in this ruin to die, all alone he would rot eternally in darkness, nothing but him and his conscience thoughts bickering among each other until the tendrils of insanity tightened around his heart and squeezed his life out into the jaws of death. Oh how he stewed his anger, his hate, his rage, his emotions boiled his blood and his corrupted blood boiled his still-beating heart. It mixed into every inch of his being, every inch of his body, it swished and swooned until it was him and he was it, a blot of death, a rotting corpse. But he still sat and he still bickered and he still hated. But over the past few days he had gained strength through anger, and willed his diseased body to stand, to walk, to run. He willed his thoughts into shrieks, and he grovelled about his tomb. Every step was a challenge but he had an eternal source of rage, a fire that had consumed his soul, and his boiling blood bubbled through his rotting flesh and seeped into the cold earth. He ranted and raved and screamed at the invisible pillars that he longed to smash. Soon he had mapped out every inch of his tomb, and knew even in total darkness every room and wall, nook and crack, stain and rot. He even had discovered the sealed door, which they had locked him behind. For days he had scraped away at it until his fingers where skeletal and sharp. He gave up on the door and sunk into the bliss of darkness, forgetting about his pain, forgetting about his hunger, forgetting about his loneliness, but never forgetting about his hate, he let it light up the darkness, he danced with it, sang with it, prayed to it. He had been forgotten, he had become the forgotten, he was no longer anyone or anything, only a husk of hate and desire.<br><br>Farkil was a hotheaded pube, not afraid of death and surely not afraid of the living dead. But when he came across the stone ruins he felt the icy claws of fear grab his guts and grip them tightly. But did this discourage him from exploring the darkness, embracing his fears? Hardly, he thrived off thrill and he had never been so fearful in his life. He had never felt such a pure feeling and he planned on finding whatever it was that was spooking him. Perhaps that would impress Jeane, whom no matter how he tried was unaffected by his charm. He hoped that if he could get her a special Christmas gift, he could have her. He used this thought to push past the fear and search deeper and deeper into the darkness of the tomb.<br><br>The hollowed hate was lying across the floor, listening closely to the footsteps outside. Step… Step… Step… Step… A slow beat but constant, getting closer to his tomb. Each step louder and louder until he could hear the legs that took the steps. Baggy jeans constricted against the legs at the same beat as the feet colliding with the ground. And then he could here the arms, swaying like a soldier marching, they swished too, to the beat of the baggy jeans constricting and the feet colliding. And was that what he thought it was, a heartbeat, pulsing to the beat along with soldier swishing arms and the constricting baggy jeans and the colliding feet? Yes, the beat elevated, the pulse quickened as the thing on the other side drew nearer. A wide grin slowly began to stretch along the face of the monster.<br><br>Farkil stood in front of an ebony door. The thing he sought lay behind this rotting barrier. He stuck his ear up against the door and listened . Absolute silence steeped on the other side. He reached into his rucksack and pulled out a box of matches. He opened up the small package and reached deep inside. One stick remained… He lifted the precious little matchstick out of its box. He took a deep breath and then swiped the match across the course ebony wood. A tiny flame illuminated the long hallway, and the wood. He noticed worn writing across the once strong door. He ignored it, Farkin never liked writing, nor reading writing, instead he tickled the flame across the door. The rot and mould took quickly, and soon the whole door was alight. <br><br>The Shaman floated the glowing red souls over her tiny tree, she directed there bobbing with her pinky, ring finger and thumb, on the left hand, and extracted the essence into the tree using her right foot. The builders watched in awe as the souls poured into the little Christmas tree, and gazed with their mouths a-jaw as the stump expanded outward and the peak stretched upward. The little Christmas tree grew and grew and grew until it surpassed the height of the mighty walls, and continued growing. It hulked over the town and stood strong and proud in the centre of the gawking crowd. The Shaman turned to them, and an enormous roar of enthusiasm and gratitude exploded from the amazed patrons! All had tears dribbling down their cheeks. This would be the best Christmas ever.<br><br>Farkil watched as the flames withered away, swallowed slowly by the darkness, but not before scorching the ebony barrier. Farkil waited until the darkness had completely consumed the light, and then shot his foot into the weakened wood, shattering it. Immediately there was a cold meaty hand around his throat and then a bright light… And then darkness, eternal darkness, forever darkness…<br><br><br></em></p>

                <p><em>PAIN… PAIN PAIN PAIN, A BRIGHT BURNING PAIN POURED DOWN!! Down from the sky, it entered the cold hollow wretch, stung his flesh, scolded his eyes. The forgotten freak retreated back into the darkness of his crypt. He was feeling refreshed, strong, hungry. The man who had released him remained only splattered across the forgotten freaks fingers and across his face. Everything else was gone, bone, brain, muscle, hair, everything had been sucked into the empty eternal mouth of the forgotten freak. Fresh blood, fresh meat, fresh bone, oh how he longed for more, hungered for more, he burned for more, his boiling blood continued bubbling out, but it was hotter then ever, it had tasted its sweet sweet desire! YESSSS, it had tasted revenge and oh how revenge tasted so sweet, crunching on the bones, he had chomped not only bones but it had chomped down on revenge, it had exacted his quest on this man, who had freed him from the same tomb which this man had locked him in. The forgotten freak giggled happily, and walked into the pain…<br><br>The scavengers had all returned, well, all but one, but with such festivities and merriment one man was not missed. Farkis’ only friend was dead-drunk in front of the Christmas Tree, lying empty-minded with a thoughtless smile across his face. The gates where closed and the citizens where all gathered around the tree celebrating. They all put their gifts at the foot of the Christmas Tree, not a single frown among the merry mob.<br><br>The forgotten freak shambled toward it’s old home. He saw it as soon as he walked back into the pain, and now he shambles toward it, with a cheery smile wickedly stretched across its decaying face, boiling blood dribbling down. It giggled and mumbled merrily to itself, oh how happy it was, it felt like expressing its feelings, felt like, like, like… It stopped. How DID it feel? It had never actually FELT anything but loneliness and hate. The fire in the sky disappeared across the land and the pain subsided. The forgotten freak stood, with a cheery smile across it’s decaying face contemplating on how to express it;s merriment. It could ravage and kill the bastards who had locked him away, but that wasn’t enough. It wanted more, its tongue longed for blood but his soul more. How could it express it’s pain? It’s hate? It’s happiness?<br><br>The Shaman danced among her citizens, they were all drunk on holiday spirit, some of the men were as bold to of made a move on her. She had sent them away playfully. And they had all gone happy, nothing could dent their happiness, this was the best Christmas ever.<br><br>The forgotten freak felt the cool metal that had once kept bastion for it, now kept bastion against it. It giggled and mumbled a memory of the past. It removed its hand from the cool metal wall, and stared merrily at the bloody handprint it had left on the wall. It giggled and swiped another stripe of red blood across the cold metal wall. A cry from the other side alerted it and it shifted quickly away from its painting. More cries emitted from the town. These cries slashed at the forgotten freak, they ripped at it, heated it’s boiling blood, these cries were MERRY! How? How could this be? How could they be merry? They can’t be merry, only IT could be happy, they had to suffer, cry, scream, shout, they should not be crying out in joy! It pressed its head up against the cold wall. The chill embraced it’s rotting flesh, gently pouring it’s chill into his bones. It listened closely to the other side, the inside, where it used to belong… A single bloody tear protruded through its left eye, and slipped cautiously down onto the cold metal. This went unnoticed by the forgotten freak, who was too obsessed, it had to know what made them so happy, so jolly. It heard laughter, singing, bells, chimes, clinking of bottles, and it smelled, smelled… <strong>He</strong> smelled… It ripped his face from the wall, leaving behind most of its cheek, which had been consumed by the coolness of the wall and frozen stiff. It had smelled pine. Pine? It curled over and wretched up some of Farkis’ hair. The memory was too powerful to withstand, it held its mangled head to what was left of its face and rubbed its exposed skull. It remembered the cheer, the jolliness, the laughter, but felt none of it. It had smelled pine, <strong>he</strong> had smelled Christmas. Was it Christmas? Really? Could it of actually been stripped from his bonds and freed from its hell on the eve of the most holy day, it who was demonic, evil, vile, wicked, hateful, vengeful! HAH, it thought, but did not feel. It felt no joy, no jolliness no cheer, only sadness. Sadness, which it had sealed long ago, in the early times of it’s banishment, when they had eternally excluded his as he still was, to the outside. His blood chilled, stopped boiling. It sat down; legs crossed, and put his hands up to cover his tearing eyes.<br></em></p>

                <p><em>The Shamon began to draw the attention of her citizens. She wanted to make a Christmas toast and congratulate them on all their hard work and thank them for all their troubles to make this Christmas possible. She shot her newest soul (whom she had found floating just outside the gates only an hour ago, as If begging to enter) into the crowd and wake the drunk out of their daze and avert their attention to her. She would of let them be if her head was clear, but alcohol had clouded her mind and she greatly desired all the attention of the men on her again. She stepped up to the Christmas Tree and led the soul into her palm, all eyes were on her, everyone had been woken from their trance by the blue beauty. She looked at all of them admirably, then something odd caught her eye. Outside the gates, directly across from her, stood someone. But something wasn’t right about this “someone”, why where they outside, and why were they standing like that, hobbled over to the right side, but most of all, why did she feel bare, as if her holiday spirit had been scared away by the strange outsider…<br><br>The forgotten freak stood there, hands clasped between the iron bars of the mighty tow gates. It stood there, staring at the Shamon, it’s mother of its suffering, loneliness, pain, and hate. But he did not feel vengeful, his blood had cooled, his mind cleared. He was hollow, empty, alone. He watched as she timidly approached him, watched as the heads of the merry folk turned, watched as all their smiles disappeared…<br><br>The Shamon walked toward the creature at the gates. It looked like one of those monsters outside, but FELT different. She felt the others following her to the gates, sensed that they all felt the same queer feeling from the monstrosity outside.<br><br>They came toward it, all had quizzical looks on their face. They were confused, scared, curious. Their faces sparked no flame, only sunk it`s heart deeper into loathsomeness. They saw him as he was, wicked, ugly, a freak.<br><br>The Shamon stood face to face, separated only by the thick iron bars of the gates. She studied the disease-eaten face of the freak? What made it so special? She saw nothing special in it’s eyes, saw nothing at all, only a deep emptiness.<br><br>The forgotten freak looked out upon it’s once fellow friends. It remembered many of their faces, and many of their names. Bill, sue, Griffon, Milkon, Lil’ Joe, Hypy, Kilgore, Stephano, Wertness, Shady… But he only saw them through the corner of his dieing eyes. He stared directly at her, the Shamon. They stood about a foot away, it could feel her studying him, looking deep inside his empty body, searching for something in the darkness. He looked meekly at her. He felt no hate, neither did he feel any forgiveness. Only sadness, the drooping sadness that was sucking the last of his life away. His heart felt heavy and more tears welled to his eyes. His mouth opened revealing to the Shamon some of Frakin, then exhale slowly, “H-Hello”.<br><br>The Shamon was taken back! What had just happened? Had it just spoken? This thing? This monster! THIS FREAK! But wait, that voice, that face, those eyes… They resemble someone she knew long ago, someone everyone had known, and locked away. But he is dead! HE MUST BE! HE HAS TO BE! She looked at the poor wretch in front of her and stated, in a quaking voice, “No”.<br><br>The remembered wretch exhaled painfully, “Yes”.<br><br>The whole town shuddered. They all felt the shame, they all felt the pain, they looked away in disgust at the ugliness in front of them, many of them quickly fled. The Shamon didn’t flinch. She stood strong, thankful for the mask she wore, which hid her terror and shame.<br><br>The remembered wretch watched as the Shamon turned, It listened to the Shamon tell the closest person, Reggie, to go to the bank and fetch something, It watched as Reggie returned with a battery launcher, watched as the weapon was levelled to it’s head, listened to the CRACK, felt the impact… It felt nothing, no pain, no remorse, no regret, no mercy, only a deep and lonely sadness…<br><br>The Shamon watched the headless corpse of the remembered wretch slump to the ground, she turned and saw the emptiness in the eyes of those who had stayed. No-one made eye contact with her. They all shied away, back to their tents and hovels. The cheer and merriment had disappeared, the corpse outside had stolen it.<br></em></p>
