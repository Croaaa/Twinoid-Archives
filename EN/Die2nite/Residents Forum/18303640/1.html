Today was November 6, a date firmly ingrained into my brain. Today was the day of the jump.<br>I grabbed one of the Milky Way bars I got from trick or treating yesterday and munched it as I powered up my phone. <br>I tapped my foot happily. The new season had just started, and we had a great chance of making the leaderboards. Well, we won't stay there but at least I can take a bunch of screenshots and brag =^.^=<br>I talked on the meta chat while attempting to do homework at the same time. I also went on the quakenet chat, and disconnected every three minutes (another aspect of my phone's derpiness).<br>An hour before attack, another hardcore town opened, much to our dismay.<br>There was also another problem: Only three jumpers were on the chat. <br>But <span class="tid_user tid_user_1397717 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1397717">Miudo</span> was adamant. "The date of the jump is November 6. Therefore, we are jumping on November 6." <br>There was people following the Twinoid message, however. Minutes before the attack, Miudo gave the order to jump. After all, the town wouldn't fill yet anyway.<br>I decided to wait a bit. I took another piece of candy and waited for the attack to end.<br>Then <span class="tid_user tid_user_1761665 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1761665">MageShooter</span> jumped. I tried to refresh the page to jump, but it was loading and loading and just kept on loading. I ran to the computer, turned it on with shaky fingers, logged in, and clicked join a hardcore town.</p><p>I held tightly to my phone, closed my eyes, and jumped. <br>I landed in the sand. A breeze blew by, and it had that familiar putrid smell. I sagged in relief. I've missed this place so much.</p><p>I walked into town. There were many familiar faces, but also a few unfamiliar ones. I smiled. Most of the meta made it.</p><p><strong> Day 1~</strong><br>I ran to the Town Forum. "YAAAAYYYY!" I yelled, making heads turn. I looked around. To my dismay, there was already a welcome thread. <strong> I</strong> should be the one making welcome threads. After all, my thread would be neat and colorful while this thread was frayed and dirty.<br>Oh well.</p><p>I walked around town, looking at all the new things Season 6 had brought. There was a little clipboard saying "Watchmen signups here", and also a message, written in blood, on the wall of the bank: "Beware of ghouls!"<br>O-kay then... I thought. I kept on walking. "Hey Woody!" I called as I passed by <span class="tid_user tid_user_990755 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="990755">WoodenSurvivor</span>. He nodded in reply.<br>Suddenly, there was the sound of arguing from the Forum. Of course, I ran there as fast as I could.<br>Apparently, there were three griefers in town. They were shunned before I could see what happened. I felt bad. I didn't think people should be too quick to shun, at least give them a chance to explain. I knew that would also give them a chance to hurt the town further, but I still felt wrong about shunning people without warning.<br>But I didn't do anything to stop it. <br>However, soon there were snide remarks about hanging them. I tried to stop everyone from overreacting. "Remember, we're trying to rank! We have to keep as many people alive as possible!"<br>One of the three shunned agreed to help the town. I was quite happy, though <span class="tid_user tid_user_1820424 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1820424">FeedMe</span> warned me to not be naive. However, I believed in second chances, and the thinly veiled threats my meta mates gave him filled me with a slight unease.<br>Later in the day, one of the shunned waved a rusty chain in the air. He laughed and yelled, "Now you can't build the gallows!" I looked on, feeling a bit melancholy. I had wanted to make this town perfect.<br>Those two griefers were weighing down the atmosphere of the town. Everyone was tense and hostile. <br>However, there was one bit of news that brought a smile to all our faces. <span class="tid_user tid_user_1809552 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1809552">Vanish</span> had found a ruin only 8AP from town. We all cheered when we heard the news.<br>At the end of the day, the scavengers came back. Woody held a rusty chain like a trophy, cheering "Gallows!"<br>Three minutes before midnight, I tugged the heavy gates closed. My arms screamed, but the distant moans lent me strength.</p>

                <p><strong> Day 2~</strong><br>The Gallows were built in a blink. The cries of "Hang! Hang!" rang through the town. This was mob justice at its finest. After a while, the two griefers were rounded up in front of the gallows in preparation for getting hanged. <br>Despite their imminent death, they acted cocky. One of them even had the nerve to make a obscene comment about me. I stared at his crazed, laughing face and pointedly looked away.<br>Soon, only one more complaint was needed for both of them. I steeled myself and walked to the complaints board. I resolutely clicked the "submit" button for that vulgar man.<br>Suddenly, my vision flashed black and white. A box saying "XmlHttp error: ..." blocked my vision. I couldn't see anything. I fainted.<br><em> I opened my eyes and saw that I was in a proper house. From before the apocalypse, I guess. Snow was blowing in fat flakes outside, and my sister was sitting across from me. In my hand I held a phone. <br>My mind rebelled. What? I have a sister? Where am I? I looked at the screen of the phone, and felt myself falling, falling, falling...</em><br>I sat up and saw that I was back in the town. Hmm, that was a weird hallucination. I actually thought it was real. The man was already dead, hanging from the gallows. He had a grotesque grin on his face, and his tongue was hanging out, purple and swollen. Somehow, instead of being grossed out I was filled with a maniacal glee. Serves him right! I grinned.<br>In a few long strides, I was at the complaints list for the other griefer. I pounded the submit button with my fist.<br>And I blanked out again. <br><em> "XmlHttp error: an unknown error occurred, preventing the page to load properly..."<br>I was sitting in that fancy house again, and that message reminded me of last summer. Memories flooded through me. Frustration, annoyance, lost hope, frustration... I shook my head to clear it. What was wrong with me? I walked almost like a zombie to my piano and sat down heavily. My body felt wrong... No, it was my surroundings that felt wrong. I pulled out my cell phone, a gesture so repeated it felt like a reflex. I hit the refresh key...<br>"Error: citizen doesn't exist."<br>I laughed. That was the griefer I killed! The phone screen loomed larger... And larger... The last thing I saw before losing consciousness was the snow, dancing in the air outside the window. </em><br>"Hey, Tara. Tara! Tara!" <br>I rubbed my eyes. It was Woody calling my name. <br>"They've been hanged!" <span class="tid_user tid_user_1533371 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1533371">lunovox</span> cheered. I smiled widely, and joined in the party celebrating the deaths of the two people. <br>Suddenly, <span class="tid_user tid_user_1491389 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1491389">2tousent</span> pointed a finger at a figure dressed in black. "Don't act like that... Or you might be the next one," he growled. <br>The person in black scowled. "The next one?? What are you, a troll?" he snapped, hands forming into fists.<br>"I'm not a troll, but I don't like the way you're acting," 2tousent looked like he was about to punch him. <br>I laughed nervously, and put my hand on 2tousent's shoulder.<br>"2tousent, we're not the mafia. Seriously, we aren't."<br>The party stopped soon after that. <br>When night was starting to fall, I told Miudo that I was going to go explored the Abandoned Bunker. I was also to unlock some doors.<br><span class="tid_user tid_user_1936056 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1936056">Mollz</span> had gained some Hero skills for a day and made imprints of the locks, which she brought back to town.<br>The problem was no one converted the impressions to keys. <br>So I had to, and I grabbed a bottle of Winness on my way out of town.<br>I smiled ruefully. In this world, who cares that I was underage?<br>I started my long trek through the World Beyond while pushing the trolley.<br>I rested a bit to drink my water, and after some more walking I was at the entrance of the ruin. <br>I took three deep breaths. I would need them...<br>I gathered my courage and entered the ruin. I had a hastily scribbled map in my hand, courtesy of the people who had explored the ruin before me. But more importantly, I had three keys.<br>The inside of the bunker made me claustrophobic. I tried to walk fast but I suspected that running into walls wasn't very efficient. <br>I almost ran right past the first door I was supposed to unlock. I stopped just in time, and managed to jam a Magnetic Key into the lock. The door opened with a little click. I ran inside. It was an office of some kind. I looked around frantically. There seemed to be nothing useful, so I ran back out.<br>I had been holding my breath the whole time. I was starting to run out of air. I exhaled a little bit as I scrambled through the deserted corridors, looking for the next door to unlock. <br>I almost collapsed in from of the next door. I sank to the ground as I stuffed the key into the lock. I charged into the room, grabbed the first thing I saw- a spy rocket - and chucked it in my trolley. <br>Black and blue spots were starting to appear in my vision. I knew I wasn't able to hold my breath for any longer. But the air here was toxic, and I... I...<br><em> I held my breath while timing myself. Finally, I couldn't stand it any more and breathed in deeply. I showed the timer to my dad. "See?" I proudly told him with my twelve-year-old voice. "I can hold my breath for a full minute! Most people can only do thirty seconds!" I grinned, feeling special. My lungs burned a bit.</em><br>I took a deep breath and nearly choked on the green, hazy air. Better not pass out again, I told myself sternly. Or else... or else...<br>I gave up trying to complete my thought and ran to the next door to be unlocked. I passed by an open door but I ran right pass. I only realized that I should've went in after I was quite a distance away. Oh well... <br>My oxygen meter was reaching 40%. If it reached zero, I would no longer be able to function. "Fudgemuffins..." I cursed under my breath, then coughed from the poisonous green fumes.<br>I spat into my hand and saw blood. Uh-oh. <br>I tried to run faster but tripped over my trolley and fell onto the ground. I half-crawled to the next door.<br>But though I jammed the last remaining key in as hard as I could, it wouldn't open. <br>Only when many precious seconds passed did I realize that the lock needed a bump key. I only had a magnetic key.<br>I tried to clear my throbbing head. The marks on the map were blurring together.<br>Just head north... I told myself. Turn, then turn again...<br>I was nearly out of air. There was no time to think. I started to panic.<br>Thankfully, my subconscious brain already processed the right way. I made it to another locked door, which gave way with a click by my key. I ran in. It was a dorm of some kind. I coughed up more blood, then willed my legs to not betray me. <br>I ran through the halls, no longer knowing exactly where I was. I passed by halls with doors in them, but my vision was starting to narrow alarmingly. I ran right pass.<br>Finally, I stopped in front of the entrance. I looked at my oxygen meter. I still had 20% oxygen. I could've explored more rooms, I thought.<br>I stumbled out the ruins and collapsed. <br><em> The first time I explored a ruin was in another season, another life. I had been so excited... I had no map, so I wandered around aimlessly. I made a map in my mind, and headed back at the first sign of confusion. It was, all in all, a very noobish operation. </em><br>I'd better go back to town, I thought. My brain hurt, and the bottle of booze didn't help much. Everything looks happy... Ah.</p>

                <p><strong> Day 3~</strong><br>I have such a hangover today. My head feels like it's ripe for explosion, like a grapefruit. Ugh.<br>I just don't feel like moving... But I dragged myself outside when I heard a commotion. There's just no quiet days are there??<br>I rubbed my eyes. Miudo was standing in the middle of the town square, facing a person in a black cloak. His name was <span class="tid_user tid_user_1820424 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1820424">FeedMe</span>, and I vaguely remembered that it was the person 2tousent threatened yesterday.<br>Wow, it feels like so much longer before than that.<br>The crowd gathered around, whispering. I had the distinct feeling that I was missing something.<br>Suddenly, Miudo punched that guy full in the face. His head snapped back. Miudo turned around and jammed his elbow into the guy's gut, and then snapped his arm back, breaking the guy's nose. He fell over onto the packed dirt. <br>I watched, flabbergasted. He looked dead. Why did Miudo just do that?<br>Silently, Miudo walked over and lifted the cloak gently from the dead man's body.<br>I gasped. The man had dark spots all over his face and skin, and there was blood around his mouth. His eyes were completely red and blank, seeing nothing. Miudo kicked him lightly. A bit of flesh broke off.<br>"This is the one that ate <span class="tid_user tid_user_43971 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="43971">Leyva17</span> this morning..." Miudo explained.<br>The dead man <span class="tid_strike">is</span> was a ghoul, I realized. Miudo was so observant... I had no idea.<br>The excitement over, I walked back home to sleep. I laid in my tent, but I couldn't fall asleep. As I looked at the green fabric of the ceiling, I thought, everyone is dying... And everyone WILL die... I can't stop that, any less than I can stop time. I can only try my best each day. Hope for the best, and live another day.</p><p><em> The teacher was asking some poor kid a question. I had my flute in my lap. I must've dozed off in band class again. That has been happening too much lately... But I couldn't open my eyes.<br>"Quarter note," I heard a girl next to me whisper, trying to help the kid out.<br>The kid didn't hear her. "I dunno," he said.<br>"Tara, help him out," the teacher said.<br>Huh? Me? I didn't even know what the question was... "Quarter note?" I ventured.<br>"Yes, the quarter note gets the beat," the teacher said. "Now, what beat is the eighth note on?"<br>The eighth note on... Where? I hesitated. "The and of... Four?" A complete guess.<br>"Correct." Next to me, someone snickered.<br>After a while, I started to fall asleep again. I just couldn't open my eyes. The things I saw when I closed them, however, were beyond strange. <br>A crow, standing in the middle of a barren wasteland. People, shuffling around in worn blue uniforms. Talk. Arguing. ...Mattresses??<br>I must be going mad. </em></p>
