                <p><strong>First thing first: Prepare yourself! It will be long and silly.</strong></p><p>I need some help from outer source because there is a <span class="tid_strike">noob</span> guy in the town who drives us crazy. I'm on the edge of my patience.<br>Can someone explain the zombie spread on the map so clear that a 6 years old downer kid can understand it?<br> <br>Our team is in a random small town. There is a thread on the forums about the zombie killing. We encourage the others to kill as much zed on day 1 as possible to make zombie management, scavenging and camping later easier.<br>There is a French guy who plays the Hordes, but speaks a bunch of crap.</p><br><p>Just some of it:<br>- Zombies spread the same. The only thing is that when you kill some zombies, a propotionnal number die too without being killed. But it works everyday, not just today, you'rewasting weapons into killing anarchicaly.</p><br><p>- No, the high desnsity zones are justethe zones the fastestly spread, but it is not modified by the density. The number of zombies that spawn on each zone, each day, is already defined at the beginning of the map.</p><br><p>- <span class="tid_user tid_user_5058351 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="5058351">Walar</span> (he is quoting me here)<br><cite>You are wrong in this. If there is a ruin in one corner, which is cleared from zeds and there are no other infected zones next to it, zeds won't appear again the next day there.<br><br>Been there, done that.</cite></p><p>If you clear a zone with a large number of zombies, the numer of zombies dead "par d√©sespoir" as we say in French, is deduced for the following day. So often, there are no zombies the nextday bescause the spread is less importantthatthe number of zombies dead "par desespoir".</p><p>An example : When you kill 7 zombies on a zone, at midnight, 2 zombies more dies. It's like that. So if there is a spread of 1 zombie on the following day, if there are 9 zombies on the zone, and if you kill 7 of them, there will be 9 - (7 +2) +1, so 1 zombie.</p><p>But if there were 8 zombies. There will be 8 - (7 + 2) +1 = 0.</p><p>And if you kill all the zombies : 9 - (9 + 3) + 1 = -2 ==&gt; So 0.</p><p>It's a bit hard to understand, but it's the rule, and nothing to do with spread. Good night <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_blink.gif" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p>- This is my post:<br>Yeah, we already know that. Nothing new, and not hard to understand.<br>Where you are wrong is:<br><cite>The number of zombies that spawn on each zone, each day, is already defined at the beginning of the map <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_blink.gif" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></cite><br>There is no such thing as a determined zombie growth for each zone each day.<br>If you would be correct with that determined nonsense then it would be like:<br>And if you kill all the zombies : 9 - (9 + 3) + 1 + 9 (determined)= -2 + 9 ==&gt; So 7.<br>Which is simply stupid.</p><p>It will be 0 as you calculated and as long as you can keep the neighboring zones clear it will stay 0.</p><br><p>- French guy again:<br>You only count the "spawn on the following day, not for all days. If you are at "less something" zombies, you say 0. But the following day again, there will be one zombie or 2 more.A negatve value is set to 0 so zombies continue spawninng after that ^^.</p><p>(Hard to explain in english).</p><p>With your calcul, it gives :<br>And if you kill all the zombies : 9 - (9 + 3) + 1 = -2. -2 is set to 0 the following day. And the 9 zombeis which appears the days following (so after two days) appears nomally. So 0 + 9 = 9.</p>
