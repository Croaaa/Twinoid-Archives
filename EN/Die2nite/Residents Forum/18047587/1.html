Drink while you write but write D2N<br>2. Say what you're drinking in the D2N booze closest to your reality (sticking w/ the RP theme that even if you're just drinking orange juice you're actually drinking Wake the Dead and if you're really drinking beer then you'll likely have to say your tipple is Winness)<br>3. You must <em>not</em> edit anything you write (leave them typoes alone... even if it wasn't the drink at all that caused 'em!) 'cause that's part of the fun</p>

Good spirits thoyugh -- me and the Wake.<br><br>I'm hearing the quiet groans outside from the now sedate undead. I'll never understnad why they roll through moods of killing frenzy and then hours of peace. I suppose I should be thanksful but honestly I just palian *cough* plain exscape the wondering. It's probably helpful really, wondering that is... if we could figure the bastards out maybe we could stop th3em. That's what we're all here for tonight. Drinking and brainstorming 'cause shit is starting to get dire over here.<br><br>Not too much figuring goingon so far tho. I'm wasting paper drinking and journaling while we get settled. Limey and Stranger and talking about life as it was and the general consensus is to get our drunk on beorofre getting down to business. I hate the life as it was talk but maybe that's useful too siknce it gives folks something theywant to get back to. I don't konwo about that for me... life wasnt' bad. Mostly I just don't really want to die in a dsertert eaten by zombies and just plain odn't really want to die (it's not like other folks haven't made that choice for their future).<br><br>I feel like I should stop journaling, though. That the only thing that's going to happen to me if I keep that up is that I'll end up with nothing of me left but the words blowing around the desert like I've found and read every so often.</span></span></p>

Maybe not safe. But what the hell, it's not like I've got anything to lose at this point. I take a healthy swallow of the whiskey-and-whatever and suppress a shudder. That won't do. I pull the handful of sweets out of my cloak and toss em in, swirling it so they dissolve. Sure, those were my emergency rations, looted off a former friend after an unlucky night camping, but I'm beyond caring about the nearly blasphemous waste. Escape is what matters.

If the don't get back soon I may have to drag my ass off this craptastic chair and start digging through the rats to water myself because my first bottle is long gone and now I'm starting to feel out of spirits -- definitely both senses.<br><br>How did we get there.

I don't let Weddings into my life very oftne but this one seemed harmless enough, as in, seemed like it would be less of a Wedding and more of piss-up, which is something I cna get behind.

It's full of idiots, it amake s you an idiot, and these days it feel s like a eparody of what you thing it hsould be (except what you think it should be comes from film and TV making you the biggest idiot of all for developing expectations).<br><br>There were ozombies in Vegas while w e were there for the Wedding. I still can't figure out if they were rieal or not. Didn't expect a szombie reality at the time so, uh, wasn't really paying attention. I can wish in one han d over that one now. Might help to have one single, damn clue if this stated 8 days ago or only 6, in theicity or outside and I wont ever know unless this gets fixed.<br><br>Wow. Holy shit. Someone else just walked into the bar, found the Mutt and got what was probably supposed to be my Wake and then put candy in it. And now I can't stop staring at them: I'd say their treating this place like it's normal is making me think maybe I'm just solo fucked in the head on this but the candy in the Wake tells me that I'm still living in exactly the same screwy place I thought I was 1- minutes ago.</span></span></p>

Whooooo telepathic booze ordering! ... and drink deep while I consider this with a low chuckle.<br><br>Oh wait, cute stranger is talking again and she's not lisping. Guess she's just weird. Haha weird. Another amusing concept, given the givens of the givens. "Together?" Cute, but empty headed. "Together gets you killed. Or you have to kill." I remember the killing. Oh yes. It is not one of my fonder memories. Except Steve. He had it coming. And maybe the pizza guy. Pizza guy zombie was just funny. Things are still funny... is that good? I don't even know, but at least I can smile. I feel my mouth stretch into one now and it feels good. I take another sip of booze. That is feels good too. I don't even mind the taste this time.

As I move to help Slinky up from her fall, she jumps up on her own and backs up suddenly. She went from eyeing me to freaking out rather more quickly than most. Not that I'm surprised... Disappointed, maybe? Yes, disappointment, this feeling is. Does that mean I'm lonely? Dangerous. But still... Was it something I said? Maybe she hasn't had to kill anyone yet. Lucky. Or... unlucky. What if she can't? If she can't, she's dead, she just doesn't knwo it yet. <br><br>Hmm... the barkeep is nowhere to be found. Noisy has the right idea though. I reach behind the bar and grab the first bottle my fingers touch and uncork it. A long swig that tastes like burning ensues. Good stuff. I should stop though. Much more than this and I'll be dead for sure if the zombies come. Already questionable outcome. Plus, Slinky needs it more than me. I recork the bottle lightly and toss it to her, hoping that doesn't lead to a waste of booze.</span></span></p>

She's saying something about not bieng stupid and there's a pool of vomit now mixing in wtih the sharp smell of the vodka at my feet. The snetch of it all makes my head reel and I feel like I'm falling again without leaving my feet. I back up two more step against the wall to stay steady.<br><br>I'm more stesdy here but hitting the wall brings the panic back that I don't know where I am, where my freinds went, and where these two strnage girls came from when there`s been no one but our wedding group for th e apst week. The smeell in the air is maknng me sick to my guts and I know I haev to get out of here.<br><br>"Uuuuh. Have either of you seen my frineds? I was here with four or give peoiple a couple of hours ago and we were just trying fto figure outwhat happened ot us and what we're going to do next away from the turoil of our camp.

Everything is distant and hard to focus on and both girls are just looking and looking at me and I feel half frozen in time.<br><br>"I think I'm getting sick being in here an this dust 'n ' dartk and the stuff on the ground", I say gesturing in front of me and toward the sick girl "I need to get out and get some air and find my friends again. I ocome back here sometimes maybe we can come back again tomorrow and figure things out and tlak about where we all came from and what we can do."<br><br>I stumble a few steps to the right, feel my hand on the edge of the door ajam and slide slowly around and out it blinking back in the desert light and start stumbling off where I know our campsite is.

I'm trying to mak efriends after all. I stagger a bit and almos tfall into the puddle of my puke. Eeewwww... I kindo ffeel sbad about thata but oh well, I just hope it doesn'nt happen afain. <br>The girl is walking slowly away. i try to walk faster put i tripped over my own feet and fell face first into th esand. I stand back up and try to walk. The sand in my eyes hurt so much I can't see anything and it was really annoying. But I keep on stumbling after that girl which was good since the next place we come to was covered in zombies. <br>But I'm just so tired I nearly pass out, I feel kind of bad too. I try to run away from the place but I had a feeling that I wasn't gooing anywhere. A zombie was coming over to me and I wonder whether zombies are really bees after a;sll. I try to run forum it from I couldn't leif t my feet.</p></span></div>
