                <p><strong>On the reverse side of rumpled notepad</strong></p><p>It may sound cliche, but I can not find better words to start... The fact that you are reading this means that I'm already dead. And you found my notebook, which I normally used for work records before everything collapsed in hell. No, don't think bad, I'm not a pessimist. Like others I hope for the best, I believe that it is necessary just to survive another day, another week, maybe a month, and we will be certainly rescued by someone. National Guards will arrive with helicopters and machine guns, they will clear the way and bring all the survivors to safety. Or at least give us a vaccine against the virus. Or, in extreme cases, just explain what the hell is going on, because no one still even got news from the outside world.<br>I am a realist. And, unlike others, can understand perfectly well the difference between faith and facts, dreams and forecasts. And the facts are: we are very deep in the ass. And even if anyone will be able to survive until better times - it just will not be me.<br>I decided that technical information from my notebook may be useful to someone. Especially now, when there is no internet and mobile communication, even the book is extremely difficult to obtain, when weird creatures wandering everywhere... And I will do my best, so even in a case of my death notebook will not be lost. Perhaps, information from it will save many lives.<br>I'm a technician. Expert on nuclear physics, to be precise. In this notebook you can find information about the construction of reactors, routing of electrical networks, some details from the course of the “resistance of materials”, classical physics and mechanics. And numbers Pi and e up to fifty decimal places. However, there is one problem - many notes made in my native language. In Russian. Shit happens, and at the beginning of the apocalypse I was in a foreign country, in the middle of nowhere. Who ever could know, that this business trip will finish like that... Just turned out that in our department I was the only one who knows English at a sufficient level for the "exchange of experience".<br>And now, after a crazy day with a lot of events and new acquaintances, a couple of free hours stood out and I decided to keep a diary. I just required to maintain a kind of "Chronicle". I will write the names and events without pins and without morality. After all, those who find this notebook should learn something about me and the people around me, that provided all kinds of support in this difficult time. Or maybe you will use the paper with my scribbles and invaluable knowledge to build a fire or wipe your ass. This is the thing I can not forecast.<br>Well. At this point I will probably finish opening remarks and move on to the point. I apologize in advance for any mistakes or inaccuracies in the text. You know, I am writing in a hurry, with a disgusting light, and the language is not my native.</p>

                <p><strong>Day 1. Welcome to Oozing Inn</strong></p><p>I'd like to start the story from the very beginning, from the day of X, as we call it. However, a lot of time has passed since then and many things happened, so I am not even able to sort all the events in a chronological order. Perhaps I will tell you this story on the following pages. Now I will just say that it has been about two months since zombies staged a general panic in the supermarket and I miraculously got out of town and went to wander in the deserts. On the one hand it was the right decision: chance to meet the monster here is much less than in metropolitan areas with high population density and, as a consequence, a huge number of zombies. On the other hand it became very difficult to find food and water, and I met new dangers: wild animals, snakes and scorching heat. Anyway, after a whole series of events, walks and changes of shelters, this morning I came across this place.<br>To be honest, I was purposefully going here for the last two days. Many kilometers before I saw signs of "intelligent life": footprints in the sand, dead zombies, fireplaces and the temporary lodgings. And all these traces went into one direction. And yesterday I saw absolutely definite sign. It was a long board in the sand with the inscription:</p><p>«<strong>Everyone who needs – come Inn!<br>10 kilometers NE</strong>»</p><p>And this morning I saw ... A huge camp. In the circle of grubby barricades a whole tent city was located, in which were bustling a couple of dozen people. To my surprise, I even heard the barking of dogs. Also on one side of the barricades was some semblance of the gate leaves, and above them stood a huge billboard with two words written with a red ink: «<strong>Oozing Inn</strong>». Apparently, it was somehow dragged from the roadside. And finally, I belatedly realized that until I was staring at all of this I have been noticed: two people in camouflage were looking right at me and talked about something. I had to throw away all doubts and move towards them. It was too late to change the decision and try to escape: if it is bad people, I would be hunted down and caught. And on the way here I drained the last reserves and anyway could not last for a long time without help. How lucky I was...<br>Only after coming closer I saw that one of these people ... Was a girl! It is a pity that I do not understand the units and ranks of the American army, and still have not bothered to ask them. I have no idea what is the meaning of letter "G" on the uniforms and still conditionally call them Guardians. The guy was taller than me for half a head, tanned and with short black hair, but not very broad in the shoulders. The girl much shorter in stature, but obviously older than both of us. At the first sight I would say she is around thirty. Smile made her face with regular features pretty cute, but some harshness in eyes, black hair, neatly tucked into a bundle at the nape and confident strut were talking about serious combat exposure.<br>Only when I went up to a distance of ten steps they stopped to exchange words and drew all the attention on me. The guy friendly waved:<br>- Welcome to the Inn, stranger! – He had pretty cheerful and sonorous voice and the letter R sounded especially expressive. - Make yourself at home, we are very happy to all newcomers!<br>- Uhm... Hello, - was the only thing I could utter.<br>- Is everything OK with you? - spoke the girl. - These friends did not bother you too much? - She pointed to the zombie corpse, lying next to the barricades.<br>- I am fine, thanks. - Their unprecedented friendliness made me discouraged.<br>- It's pleasure to hear! - she said with a big smile on face. - Rico, will take a duty here? I'll bring him to the main, and the guys need to be instructed.<br>- Affirmative, Lieutenant! - blurted man and saluted.<br>- Come with me. - Really? This girl have a higher rank? Somehow I did not dare to protest and followed her into the camp.<br>Some mess reigned around. People were mostly too busy and did not even looked at us: someone hammered pegs into the ground, trying to tie the tent, another was shoving rags in a backpack. A small queue lined up around the table at which sat pretty girl. When I passed through she gave another uniformed guy one of the flasks and a paper bag from the table and began to write something down in a notebook, holding a pen with her long-nailed fingers, covered by a blue polish. <br>Company of a several of guys and girls laughed, looking like a guy depicts a zombie and talks animatedly:<br>- And then she is like – wooo, rrr, wooo! - among other things, his "roar" sounded really similar to a dead man. - Then I told her : “I'm sorry, honey, but my heart is already taken”. And brandishing...<br>- Hey, <span class="tid_user tid_user_8092356 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8092356">syndesis</span>! - Interrupted him off my companion. – Stop veer tales! We are moving out in a hour.<br>- But maaam! - Replied the guy like a cartoon character. That called the new batch of laughter, but the people get up and began to diverge.<br>On the other side of the camp I saw a small "paddock", inside which half a dozen fluffy dogs were playing, all completely white in color and resemble each other like two drops of water. I'll have to find out what kind of breed it is. Near the paddock girl explained something a group of people, but I did not hear the words.<br>- We are here, - said my companion.<br>I stopped twirling head around and stared at the destination point. It was a real shack - small in size, but with a roof made of logs, solid door and a small glass window. It was located right in the center of the camp, and was easy to guess that this house belongs to the "Main", as opposed to all those grubby tents, beds and sleeping bags, randomly scattered around.<br>- You may be confused a little bit, - warned lieutenant. - This guy is a real shaman. But don’t worry, he is very nice! Let's go! - and she opened the door.</p>

                <p>It was pretty gloomy inside. There were a bit of furniture - a bed, a chair and a table on which were scattered drawings. Back to us was a guy in some sort of flowered robe or toga and delved into the box. He turned around and threw a couple of packets on the table, smiled and said:<br>- Oh, a newcommer? Thanks, <span class="tid_user tid_user_75676 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="75676">Viggo</span>! <br>- You are welcome, - she answered. – I have things to do, may I go?<br>- Oh, of course! Sit down, - approached a guy to me, pointing to a chair.<br>- Thanks, - I answered and sat down carefully on the edge, watching with the side of my eye as lieutenant comes out of the shack.<br>- Oh, relax, man! - Without removing the smile from face he told me. For some reason I really relaxed, though continued to be shocked from happening.<br>The guy seems to have been twenty years old, maximum of twenty-two. Besides clothes all his appearance was a bit odd: long unwashed hair down to his shoulders, short sparse beard and huge tunnels in the ears. Nevertheless, he exuded an aura of great kindness.<br>- What do you prefer: lavender or Egyptian musk?<br>- Sorry, what? - I reasked.<br>- Lavender or Egyptian musk? - He repeated, holding up his packets from the table. Now I saw that it was incense sticks.<br>- Mm, anything, i don’t care, - I replied. - Sorry, just not very good in English.<br>- And where are you from? - he interested, lighting one of the sticks. Not the most pleasant smell began to spread around the shack, but I gave no sign.<br>- Russia... <br>- Oh, Russia! I love you culture! - he sounded excitedly. - Dostoevsky is one of my favorite writers! If not the favorite.<br>- It's pleasure to hear! - I repeated recently heard phrase. - My name is...<br>- No, no, no, no! - he interrupted me in mid-sentence. – Don’t call the real name, the evil spirits can hear!<br>- Are you serious? <br>- I am always serious when it comes to spirits. - However, a smile still didn’t leave his face, so I didn’t get it. - Look, everyone here calles me <span class="tid_user tid_user_1375817 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1375817">Bram</span>. You also shall choose a nickname.<br>- Mm ... Let it be Sheldon than.<br>- Like this nerd from a TV series?<br>- Well, yes, my scientist colleagues sometimes jokingly called me this way.<br>- So you're a scientist? - glowed shaman. – We are definitely needed in people like you!<br>- Well, actually, a nuclear physicist. And to say ... No offense, but can I just take a restock from you?<br>- Going to leave us so fast? – guy sighed. - Of course, we're not going to keep you here by force. But you're a pragmatic person, aren’t you?<br>- Maybe, kind of.<br>- Then look. We have a large community here. There is a well with drinking water, food supplies for a few days, weapons and people who can do the most different jobs.<br>- Of course.<br>- So, you should completely understand that it is much better to stick together, so we have a better chances. We have to choose the place for the camp wisely, it's perfect: a couple of kilometers from here passes the highway, there are a variety of cafes, motels and shops where you can profit useful loot. It is very few zombies around, although new ones can come always, but it is not a place in a whole world now where you can totally hide. Still want to go?<br>- I don't know… Just…<br>- I see. You Don’t believe us yet, it's understandable. We may give you all you need and you can go, but may we have a deal first?<br>- Of course. – I just wanted to end this conversation faster, because the smell of Egyptian musk became really annoying.<br>- Earn it. - He sounded serious. - Spend a day here, make a job like everybody else does, and then you are free. Is it acceptable? <br>- Sounds reasonable.<br>- It's pleasure to hear! - He said the phrase of the day with his trademark smile. - Then look. - He pointed to a large sheet of paper on the table. It looked like a homemade map. - We are here. And today we are sending everyone to search for usefull stuff. To cover the biggest distance everyone shall go in a 9 kilometers distance around the camp and scavenge in his own quadrand. I think… This one is free. Can you go there and check?<br>- I think so.<br>- Nice. Then go to <span class="tid_user tid_user_75676 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="75676">Viggo</span>, she will soon make a briefing for mission. Then <span class="tid_user tid_user_1725218 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1725218">Deblyn</span> will give you daily ration of food and water. And return before darkness! Gates are closed at 10 PM, don’t make everyone worried! You know how zombies are dangerous at night!<br>And so it happened. I spent all the day searching in sands, did not meet any zombies, though all were given the radio to call for backup if something happens. I brought back a couple of planks, iron plate and a broken electronic device: decided to find a use for some of motherboards. After returning I was persuaded to spend the night in the camp with no acception of any cotradict. They found a sleeping bag for me, and now I'm writing in a diary at the light of candle, listening to the noises of camp. Tomorrow at dawn I'll have to make a decision - to stay or to leave. However, I think it will be pretty obvious.</p>

                <p>Sorry for long waiting, it took me a week to write new chapter instead of promised 2-3 days.</p><p>This way i may suggest that you shall wait for the new part at next thursday, but still will not make promises.</p><p>Anyway.. Here we go!</p><br><p><strong>Day 2. We are not alone?</strong></p><p>I still didn’t manage to leave the Inn. Everything came out somehow by itself: I just happened to be too busy to think about alternatives.<br>I was awakened before dawn with asking for assistance. We with <span class="tid_user tid_user_75676 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="75676">Viggo</span> quietly proceeded to the shaman’s house, stepping over the sleepers. It were three persons in the shack already, if not say four. <span class="tid_user tid_user_1375817 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1375817">Bram</span> was talking with a girl who sat on the floor and scratched fluffy dog behind ear. On a chair, hugging his knees, sat unfamiliar to me lad. In appearance he was clearly not more than eighteen, and his face was so dirty that it was impossible to see the features. His soaked with blood and mud clothes smelled disgusting, so we did not close the door behind us.<br>- It becomes intimately here, - noted <span class="tid_user tid_user_1375817 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1375817">Bram</span>. – I shall improve my house today.<br>- Do you need help? – the girl asked.<br>- Just send me all boxes, barricades and chests. I will take some iron from warehouse… Oh, - he shuddered. – You are unfamiliar yet. This is <span class="tid_user tid_user_5248190 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="5248190">Daxio</span>, the dog trainer. And here is Sheldon, our new scientist!<br>- Nice to meet you! – she waved to me.<br>- Arf! - Barked the dog.<br>- Excuse me, but may I ask, why did you wake up me so early? - I barely restrained to clamp my nose.<br>- We are so sorry for that! – doggy girl rose from her knees. – It looks like you are the only one who can help us. This guy, - she pointed to a lad, - seem to be Russian. And totally don’t understand us.<br>- And who is he?<br>- A newcomer. -Shaman answered. - Scurried around the camp in the middle of the night. He could be considered as a zombie, if not for this boy, - he patted the dog nape.<br>The guy was scared. Even after hearing the native language he continued to think that was captured as a prisoner. It took at least half an hour to convince him that here he can find shelter and food. Only then he finally named himself as <span class="tid_user tid_user_8039934 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8039934">Jimmy_DeGriz</span>. At first I was instructed to accompany him to the well and wash up, but he asked for food. He ate a half-eaten chicken wings in seconds - apparently, was starving for the last days. By the time I finally made him to wash, the dawn came and camp woke up. I didn’t manage to finish watching interrupted dreams.</p><p>We still had some time before the briefing, so I began to wander aimlessly around. Jimmy glued to me and asked about everything, although I did not know anything myself. Almost nothing has changed in the camp, except more tents appeared and in the middle formed solid pile of junk collected yesterday. Quite haphazardly were laying planks, iron pieces, machine parts, batteries, furniture, although <span class="tid_user tid_user_1725218 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1725218">Deblyn</span> tried to sort everything by categories: weapons, food, miscellaneous. Now she stood near this heap and obviously didn’t want to dig into this and spoil manicure, although was appointed as supplies keeper.<br>- Do not fall down, cr-row! - I heard a familiar voice and went to look. <br>Tanned guardian, holding a ladder near a shaky structure, turned around and waved in greeting.<br>- Hi, Sheldon! And here is our newcomer? What is your name?<br>- Он что-то от меня хочет? - Jimmy asked me in Russian.<br>- This is Jimmy, he doesn’t speak English, - I replied in his stead.<br>- Got it. I am <span class="tid_user tid_user_4179546 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="4179546">FallenRico</span>, - he spoke slowly and staring into the eyes of the boy, like if he were talking with the patient. – And there is <span class="tid_user tid_user_1725097 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1725097">WalkinCrow</span>, - he pointed upward.<br>Only now I noticed him. On the top of a simple construction height of about three meters, consisting of four logs-pillars and a platform made of sump, a man in a cloak was sitting. He had not even turned around, because the construction strongly staggered from the wind and creaked, so he clung the board with one hand while tried to make some notes on paper with the other. Everything that I have seen is brown cloak and long, raven-black hair, tucked away in the tail.<br>- Чё он там забыл? – asked Jimmy.<br>- Меня спрашиваешь? – I shrugged. - What is he doing up there? - I translated the question for Rico.<br>- Looking around for zombies. It is kind of watchtower.<br>- You couldn’t nail down a couple of boards along the diagonal? – I wondered.<br>- For what? <br>- For the spatial stability. Create rigidity in three dimensions, and it will cease to wander.<br>- Can you explain in normal language? - soldier scratched his head.<br>- I will better just do it. Come on, help me to drag, - I said to Jimmy, who was already twitching my arm, trying to understand what is talk about.<br>- Say hello to <span class="tid_user tid_user_1725218 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1725218">Deblyn</span>! – Crow roused himself and turned around, almost falling down. Looking at his huge hooked nose I finally understood why he was given such a nickname.<br>After a few minutes everything was done. Plying with stone I nailed two boards at the bottom, after what gave an improvised tool for Crow to nail the other ends to the top. He stood up to his full height and wiggled hips, depicting kind of dance.<br>- Wow, its working!<br>- We can continue to improve it, - I said. – Make it higher, like 10 meters or even more…<br>- I catch you up on that! – smiled <span class="tid_user tid_user_4179546 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="4179546">FallenRico</span>.<br>Ignoring the ladder Raven jumped to the ground. With his cloak fluttering in the wind it looked pretty impressive, but Rico only grimaced.<br>- What did <span class="tid_user tid_user_1725218 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1725218">Deblyn</span> say? – asked the jumper.<br>- What? – I didn’t understand.<br>- Well, when you took the boards from stock.<br>- Ah, anything. Was too busy, just allowed me to take anything I need.<br>- Arf! Arf! - Our dialogue was interrupted by dog, which appeared from nowhere. He ran up to me, wagging his tail. I squatted down and he immediately licked my hand, which I gave him to sniff.</p>

                <p>- Where did you come from, boy? - I asked, scratching his ear.<br>- I am s.. so sorry! - Girl with leash in hand ran to us, trying to speak out of breath. – It is hard to keep track of him! - She clearly was not more than 15 years old, and in the "past life" certainly considered herself to some of the subcultures: two hair strands were dyed purple. Something in her appearance was very familiar...<br>She tried to wear a leash on the dog, but it ran a few steps away and began yapping playfully dodging her attempts.<br>- It is totally not necessary to keep track, <span class="tid_user tid_user_1400164 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1400164">katja</span>. Give them freedom! - said came up <span class="tid_user tid_user_5248190 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="5248190">Daxio</span>. - Here, Tuttypie! - She patted her leg, and the dog immediately ran to it.<br>- Katja? Sounds like Russian name, - I noticed.<br>- No, no, no! - The girl waved her hands, transferring a leash to <span class="tid_user tid_user_5248190 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="5248190">Daxio</span>. A few seconds later it snapped around the dog’s neck. - We are from Canada with <span class="tid_user tid_user_1375817 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1375817">Bram</span>.<br>- Oh, - now I got it. – And who is the owner?<br>- It's my labradoodles! – smiled <span class="tid_user tid_user_5248190 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="5248190">Daxio</span>. - I made a living by breeding and training the puppies. Together we fled the city, and they rescued me many times! Now giving them out for everyone, they can carry things and find their way home. Maybe Jimmy wants one?<br>I turned around and saw the guy turned pale, holding on with caution in three steps distance. The dog growled looking at him.<br>- Oh, boy, what's up? - <span class="tid_user tid_user_5248190 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="5248190">Daxio</span> pulled the dog away. - Okay, it's briefing time soon, smell ya there.<br>- You are afraid of the dogs? - I asked Jimmy.<br>- Yes, we are somehow not going well together, - he said, when girls went to some distance.</p><p>Like yesterday, less than half of the camp gathered on briefing. A dozen of guardians apparently received an orders directly from <span class="tid_user tid_user_75676 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="75676">Viggo</span>, therefore did not participate. Some people did not find their presence necessary in the discussion, so were going about their business and just waited until someone will tell them directly where to go and what to do. As a result not more than twenty people gathered around <span class="tid_user tid_user_75676 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="75676">Viggo</span>, while it were near forty in camp. <br>- To sum up the previous day, - spoke lieutenant. - We have successfully explored everything within 9 kilometers and found a lot of useful junk. However, we lack of good weapons, so it was not possible to exterminate all zombies in the area. It is necessary to clean up the buildings near the highway and collapsed mineshaft, working with what we have.<br>- That's where dogs will come in handy, - said a man in his thirties, tall and wearing glasses.<br>- Explain, <span class="tid_user tid_user_57865 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="57865">Neuroguy</span>?<br>- Look. I will arm with machete, knifes, water pistols. – He began to tell. – Will try to liberate Motel 666 Dusk, for example. After that will send the dog with arms back for the next one while continuing my own scavenging. If dogs will not let us down – maybe we will manage to clear all three buildings till the evening.<br> - Makes sense! - delighted Daxio. – And don’t doubt in my guys!<br>- So be it, - nodded <span class="tid_user tid_user_75676 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="75676">Viggo</span>. - We will discuss details later. The next question is - how do we deal with the construction without the normal tools? <span class="tid_user tid_user_1725218 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1725218">Deblyn</span>, did people find something like a saw, hammer, screwdriver, anything?<br>- Not really, except a couple of nuts, bolts and nails, - said the girl. - And speaking of that... I think we need to change the policy of the supplies administration.<br>- In what sense? – asked <span class="tid_user tid_user_75676 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="75676">Viggo</span>.<br>- Well, take a look. I am carefully writing in the journal every item brought to the camp. In the same way I issue things, asking for a purpose every time. It takes a lot of time, and I noticed that some people are keeping stuff for themselves to not meet with the bureaucracy when will have need in this.<br>- And what do you suggest? <br>- To not place any restrictions on the issuance of supplies, - answered <span class="tid_user tid_user_1725218 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1725218">Deblyn</span>.<br>For a few moments a silence reigned, and I asked:<br>- You offer to arrange a communism?<br>- Sheldon, do you have any objections? – interceded <span class="tid_user tid_user_1725097 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1725097">WalkinCrow</span>.<br>- On the contrary! How can be Russian against communism? - This remark provoked laughter, but at the final we decided to accept <span class="tid_user tid_user_1725218 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1725218">Deblyn</span>’s proposal. However, I suspect that she just wanted to take off the tedious duty.<br>- Let’s return to the main question. On the one hand, we need to organize the construction, on the other - to find tools. We have already decided that today <span class="tid_user tid_user_1725097 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1725097">WalkinCrow</span> will go for further exploration – maybe will find anything? However, we have enough supplies to send one more scout. A volunteer needed.<br>- It is simple enough - said <span class="tid_user tid_user_1725097 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1725097">WalkinCrow</span>. - No hassles with zombies allowed, run away from everyone. The main thing is to cover maximum distance. You will receive a daily ration, flash grenades and medicine just in case.<br>- Call me if it comes to running! - Offered to the guy in a tracksuit, from which I still have not heard a word.<br>- So be it... <span class="tid_user tid_user_1820147 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1820147">samelite</span>, I suppose? – asked <span class="tid_user tid_user_75676 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="75676">Viggo</span>. – Crow will devote you to the details.<br>- Meanwhile we can create kind of workshop with what we have, - said the bearded man in a soiled overalls and a baseball cap.<br>- Do you need some help in this?<br>- Just a man or two, I suppose? - replied the man. - In any case, I intend to stay in the city to not allow anyone touch the coco!<br>- Maybe Sheldon with <span class="tid_user tid_user_8039934 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8039934">Jimmy_DeGriz</span> will help? – Suggested <span class="tid_user tid_user_1725097 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1725097">WalkinCrow</span>. - He just promised us to improve watchtower.<br>I translated this proposal for Jimmy, and he accepted. At this point briefing was ended, and people were scattered on business.</p>

                <p>Three of us performed a variety of work in the camp during the day. A man I worked with has been extremely talkative, and soon I found out that his name is <span class="tid_user tid_user_2708656 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="2708656">Cocoche</span> and realized why. He wailed a lot about the hen butchered two days ago, all the while calling it «coco» instead of «chicken». Goes without saying that he came from some kind of farm and had this reprimand, but strangeness did not end there. When I agreed that his idea to build hen house and collect eggs instead of murdering found «cocoes» is quite reasonably, he rejoiced and began to put forward new proposals. First, he proposed to organize a vegetable plot to feed the camp, that was not bad idea too. Then he suddenly said that he could grow a tree that with proper fertilization can give a couple of apples every day, and I barely managed not to laugh. But when he told me to grow in our future plot exploding grapefruits, capable to destroy a dozen of zombies at once, I was totally confused and began to divert the conversation in the working channel, until he came to something worse. Jimmy was not able to follow up our dialogue, so just searched and brought things from the warehouse, which I requested.<br>As a result, we managed to construct an open-air work desk and crafted a few tools out of scrap materials: hammers from sticks and bits of iron, chisel from a sturdy metal, knife sharpener. Then we made watchtower more sustainable and equipped it with rope ladder. Jimmy and I put tents in the neighborhood. Out of the <span class="tid_user tid_user_2708656 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="2708656">Cocoche</span>’s tent from time to time could be heard cackling, apparently this is the place where he "saved" chickens for the time being.</p><p>In the evening we received pleasant and unexpected news from the scouts. <span class="tid_user tid_user_1820147 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1820147">samelite</span> found an army outpost and abandoned construction site, which could give us instruments we need, though it was buried and captured by zombies. <span class="tid_user tid_user_1725097 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1725097">WalkinCrow</span> found three different buildings, but that's not all. In the desert he came across a man!<br>I do not know all the details, only realized that this man declined the offer to join us in the Inn and stated, that it is another camp not far, not smaller than ours. And besides, he offered to send us negotiators tomorrow to discuss possible cooperation. We are in anticipation and do not know what to expect from this meeting.<br>On this point I will finish the description of the day events. I completely lost the desire to leave the Inn, the future promises to be interesting!</p>

                <p>Hi Noyl, this is a great diary and storyline. I'm really enjoying it and am looking forward to the next chapter.<br>And don't worry about your english, I'm sure its better than many of our Russian. And considering my lack of ability with foreign languages, just the fact that you can write in a second language is cool to me! Continue writing and have fun with it! Hope to see you in another town soon!</p>

                <p><strong>Sup.</strong><br>Hm, 3 weeks have passed... RL stuff caught me hard and i just lost an attitude. But finally its done, and i am ready to post the 3rd chapter!</p><p>Before you will go reading i want to ask make two requests from ya:</p><p><strong>1)</strong> At first i am always curious for the number of readers, but this forum is not alowing such feature. So i created an empty youtube video for this purpose: please, just <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GETgAJGPew0">click here and leave a like or a dislike</a> if you keep reading it and want to see a new chapter <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_blink.gif" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> <br><strong>2)</strong> But actually i am doing it not for numbers, at the first place I want to increase my skills in English. So it will be wonderful if you will spend some time to copy grammar mistake found in text and tell in comments or PM how will be correct.</p><p>Trust me, i am not offended to any type of criticism. In opposite i am very lack of it =( How can i make things better and keep going if noone ever tells me what's wrong?</p><p>So, enough trashtalking. Here we go, 3rd chapter!</p>

                <p><strong>Day 3. Negotiators</strong></p><p>Today it was decided to send several teams to explore the distant buildings. In the morning all the briefing came down to calculating reserves to equip them. Their task is to clear the zone, get rid of the zombies and spend the night there despite of the risk. However, the experienced guys have promised to increase chances of survival to 100%.<br>After a long discussion five people went on the camping. A guy named <span class="tid_user tid_user_1760788 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1760788">Fortis</span> headed to the destroyed pharmacy with a young French lady, gazing down at all. Two tough guys whose names I can’t remember volunteered to clear the abandoned construction site. <span class="tid_user tid_user_1725218 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1725218">Deblyn</span> alone went to the army outpost, because there was the lowest number of zombies. However, <span class="tid_user tid_user_1725097 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1725097">WalkinCrow</span> intent on conducting her to the destination and coming back after, though was suffering from hangover: yesterday he had to take booze to overcome fatigue and complete the research mission. <span class="tid_user tid_user_1820147 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1820147">samelite</span>, passed through the same thing, felt totally disgusting and slept off, did not even come to the briefing.<br>For me as usual a job in the camp was found: the well began to give less water. The drops we managed to scoop with bucket from the bottom were mixed with mud and not very suitable for drinking. I began to think about a simple pump construction to slightly increase the reserves, but hardly found a nook in the bustling morning camp to discuss plans with enlarged "brigade": the guy named <span class="tid_user tid_user_8092356 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8092356">syndesis</span> joined us today. Unfortunately, I never got any constructive from them: new member immediately began to make fun of <span class="tid_user tid_user_8039934 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8039934">Jimmy_DeGriz</span>, trying to talk to him in Russian, though knew only a few words: matryoshka, «Меня зовут…» (My name is) and, for some reason, «Ожерелье» (Necklace). <span class="tid_user tid_user_2708656 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="2708656">Cocoche</span> shoved under my nose a bunch of explosives, arguing with foam at the mouth that it can help to arrange an underwater explosion and thus expand reserves. Eventually I spat on everything and went to the warehouse allegedly in search of things, but in fact only waiting until the camp will become a little emptier.<br>By this time only <span class="tid_user tid_user_1760788 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1760788">Fortis</span> with French rechecked the supplies, the other two teams have already gone to the buildings. I thought that time had come to build at least some walls and roof around the junk heap to be able to really call this warehouse or bank and began to figure out what size of area to withdraw for this purpose.<br>- Wait a minute! - <span class="tid_user tid_user_1375817 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1375817">Bram</span> approached us, dragging the bag on the ground. - Take it with you.<br>- What else? - Asked <span class="tid_user tid_user_1760788 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1760788">Fortis</span> already putting on a huge backpack, comparable in size to his body.<br>- Crazy kitten. - The shaman answered. - I thought I could tame it... Useless. - Out of the bag came a furious shriek and hiss.<br>- And what are we supposed to do with it? - French wondered.<br>- Throw it into the crowd of zombies. They will surely not like it!<br>- Or eat it as you do in France! - I wedged into the conversation.<br>- Sorry, what?! - The girl stared at me with wide eyes.<br>- It's about frogs, idiot, - <span class="tid_user tid_user_1760788 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1760788">Fortis</span> facepalmed, so I could see crew cut on the top of his head.<br> <span class="tid_user tid_user_1375817 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1375817">Bram</span> laughed and the bag almost ran away from him.<br>- Where did you come from, joker? – the girl outraged.<br>- Oh, sorry, I am from Russia. Maybe messed a little bit…<br>- A little bit?! You totally screwed yourself at the very moment of birth in your barbaric country!<br>- Don’t you dare to put croissants in my country! – It was my turn to become outraged.<br>- Calm down, <span class="tid_user tid_user_847 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="847">Ruby</span>, Sheldon! - <span class="tid_user tid_user_1375817 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1375817">Bram</span> said through laughter. - Not the best time to do this!<br>French snorted, threw behind her back raging bag and strode proceeded to the gate. <span class="tid_user tid_user_1760788 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1760788">Fortis</span> had to catch up with her, his run with a huge backpack and in high rubber boots looked funny. I tried to talk to a shaman, but he whinnied with the double force as soon as the two of them were out of sight. Waving his hand at me, he picked up a couple of twisted planks and wandered away.</p>

                <p>Suddenly, I found an old pump and heartily thanked in my thoughts a man who brought it. The only thing left was to clean it from rust, attach the handle, because it had previously worked from the engine and choose the tubes and hoses for the input and output. I also added a simple filtration system: first all deflated by a pump water gets into an empty jerrycan, and from there flows by gravity through the filter tube. I just ordered Jimmy to fill a copper pipe with sand and coal: water passes through it slowly and goes out a pair of drops per second, but in the end it is almost acceptable to drink. However, boiling it for safety will not hurt. <a target="_blank" href="https://pp.vk.me/c624427/v624427699/511d/Sio8_zie0PY.jpg">Here you can see a rough draft of what we have.</a><br>I thought that this work would take the whole day, but thanks to wonderful finding we finished everything by noon and filled first bucket with filtered water. Thereafter <span class="tid_user tid_user_8092356 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8092356">syndesis</span> said that the camp categorically lack of some kind of meeting hall, and we immediately realized the project of a small bar for these purposes, the benefit of free time was rife.<br>Its construction also went pretty quickly. I must say that it’s so easy to build in the desert: knock down a simple frame of boards and it will stay for many years. In Russia, such a hut would break in a couple of months, so you have to take into account a variety of weather conditions: wind, rain, snow, so even construction of a small toilet will take not less than a week. Within a few hours we managed to make floor of boards, put up a walls and were scheduled where to arrange the windows and the door, when <span class="tid_user tid_user_1820147 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1820147">samelite</span>, who was on duty at the watchtower, shouted:<br>- They are coming!<br>All those not numerous present at the camp went to the gate to welcome guests: our brigade, <span class="tid_user tid_user_1375817 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1375817">Bram</span>, <span class="tid_user tid_user_5248190 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="5248190">Daxio</span> and one guardian with short white hair, whose name I don’t know yet. He remained here just in case for the protection of the camp, and now stood cautiously with hand on holster.<br>We were approaching a delegation of five people: two of our and three strangers. Personally <span class="tid_user tid_user_75676 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="75676">Viggo</span> with <span class="tid_user tid_user_4179546 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="4179546">FallenRico</span> went to the appointed meeting place in the desert at the very morning. Just in case they took weapons with them and clearly did not expect that there will be three negotiators at once. Though two of them were female.<br>After they passed through the gate, the youngest girl of them spoke first:<br>- Hi guys! Good to see you, I am <span class="tid_user tid_user_1797494 tid_userBg tid_userFriend tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1797494">Joanne</span>! - Long blonde hair was constricted with belt on a forehead. She was wearing a loose T-shirt and a long cloth skirt. In the hands and ankles hung a whole bunch of different baubles. Footwear was missing and I winced presenting the feeling of walking barefoot on hot sand.<br>- Welcome Inn, I am <span class="tid_user tid_user_1375817 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1375817">Bram</span>. - He waved hand, causing fluttering of robe. - You should not call your real name, evil spirits may hear it!<br>- Oh, really? - Girl covered her mouth with hand. - Sorry, I didn’t know...<br>I even felt a little ashamed of our shaman, but he continued with a straight face:<br>- At least can your companions invent a nicknames?<br>- Give us time to think, - the guy smiled touching a visor of a soiled cap. Due to the vest with lots of filled pockets he looked pretty grunty, and out of the bosom of his leather boots with lacing protruded rather big sized knife.<br>- I am from Wicked Plains, and these guys are from Seven Sins! - <span class="tid_user tid_user_1797494 tid_userBg tid_userFriend tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1797494">Joanne</span> hurried to tell.<br>- Different camps? – Shaman wondered. <br>- Yes, it is actually a lot of them around! But we didn’t manage to negotiate with everyone so far… Oh! – the girl shuddered. – I have a gift for you! – She took out a red box from a shoulder-pouch and gave it to <span class="tid_user tid_user_1375817 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1375817">Bram</span>. – It's a whole mini-casino inside! You can find cards, dice, mini-roulette and other stuff here!<br>- Thanks a lot, I hope it will be useful, - smiled Bram and gave the box to blond guardian without looking inside.<br>- We love games in our town! – The girl continued to talk. - We are making bets, we compete, who will find better things, who will kill more zombies. It helps a lot to not lose heart at these desperate times! I will better... - She paused in mid-sentence. – Oh my God, what is it?!</p>

                <p>Forgetting about everything she ran deep into the camp, almost knocking over <span class="tid_user tid_user_8092356 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8092356">syndesis</span> standing on the way. He made a sour face, looking after her and shrugged theatrically. After a few seconds, <span class="tid_user tid_user_1797494 tid_userBg tid_userFriend tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1797494">Joanne</span> has appeared near the paddock with labradoodles and, leaning over the fence ruffled the scruffs of ran up dogs. <span class="tid_user tid_user_5248190 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="5248190">Daxio</span> smiled and hurried after her.<br>- It will take a while, - the woman shook her head. She was the eldest of the trio, but I can’t tell whether she is thirty years old or nearly fifty. Somehow miraculously preserved crystal whiteness shirt was buttoned to the neck and tucked under the jeans belt. Shoulder-length hair was collected at the tail. She held the posture and attentively looked around through rectangular glasses, pursing her lips.<br>- So, then... Be my quests! - <span class="tid_user tid_user_1375817 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1375817">Bram</span> raised his hands. - I think we have a lot to discuss. <span class="tid_user tid_user_75676 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="75676">Viggo</span>, Sheldon, come with me.<br>We left the whole crowd of people to exchange words and examine the contents of the box of games. I was thinking along the way if I have been already signed at the command of the camp…<br>Shaman’s house has undergone significant changes over the last days. The shack, standing here before, became just one of the rooms of the building. There were more doors and windows, and all around was almost consummated board fence. Man alone worked on the construction and refused any help, I could only wonder from his skills.<br>- Sorry for the smell, - <span class="tid_user tid_user_1375817 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1375817">Bram</span> said, opening the door and inviting everyone to enter. - Furious kitten lived here, I still can’t find where he made mess.<br>We went into a familiar room. It became much more spacious now: apparently, a bed and a box of stuff were transferred to one of the other rooms, so only a table and a few chairs were left.<br>- Have a seat! You've probably got tired of the way, - the shaman sat head of the table, and everyone followed his example.<br>- Blaire! - glowed guy removing the cap.<br>- Excuse me? – asked <span class="tid_user tid_user_75676 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="75676">Viggo</span>.<br>- My nickname. You can call me <span class="tid_user tid_user_3988087 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="3988087">Blaire</span>.<br>- So be it, - <span class="tid_user tid_user_1375817 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1375817">Bram</span> nodded. – I am the local shaman, you are already familiar with <span class="tid_user tid_user_75676 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="75676">Viggo</span>, and here is Sheldon, our scientist.<br>We shook hands. Hope I was not alone to have difficulties not to file a view about awful smell in the house.<br>- Nickname... Let it be <span class="tid_user tid_user_1757235 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1757235">Sashimi</span>, - the woman said, still looking around.<br>Negotiations dragged on. First, we have converged that the guests will spend the night here and go home tomorrow. Specified the range of the radio waves, in which we can be contacted. Pointed on the map locations of both camps: as it turned out, these guys just day ago came to the <span class="tid_user tid_user_1797494 tid_userBg tid_userFriend tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1797494">Joanne</span>'s camp with the same negotiation purposes and were going to leave, when they heard about us and decided to pay a visit too. Surprisingly, none of us could remember the name of the girl’s camp, so until then it was jokingly signed as «Hippies». Then the conversation turned to possible mutual assistance and even trading.<br><span class="tid_user tid_user_1757235 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1757235">Sashimi</span> found out about the events of the last days and suddenly began to criticize our way of life. Indeed, today we were too busy sending campers and with these negotiations, so did not organize a team for clearing the surrounding area of the zombies. The woman said that we can’t forget about it. Seven Sins are every day patrolling the surroundings for many miles around, or at one point, all unattended dead will arrive under the walls of the camp. She immediately began to suggest possible cleaning routes and apply them on the map, so we could only watch and agree with everything.<br><span class="tid_user tid_user_1797494 tid_userBg tid_userFriend tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1797494">Joanne</span> came only after half an hour but, seeing the lecturing <span class="tid_user tid_user_1757235 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1757235">Sashimi</span>, shook her head and went back. Apparently, she had to deal with something like this when the guys were on a visit to their camp. She didn’t show up again until the very end of negotiations.<br>We diverged only when it began to get dark. An unprecedented excitement reigned in the camp. A lot of people gathered around a large fire playing cards and telling stories. <span class="tid_user tid_user_1797494 tid_userBg tid_userFriend tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1797494">Joanne</span> somehow managed to craft makeshift guitar from a junk, played it and sang some catchy song. Although that sounded disgusting, some people sang along: apparently it was some kind of popular American thing, but I did not even understand the words. After a bit of wandering around the camp and finding out the news, I went to my tent and began to write in a diary. <br><span class="tid_user tid_user_8039934 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8039934">Jimmy_DeGriz</span> disappeared somewhere, I saw him only recently in his tent. Now he is snoring quite loud next door.<br>I have not much left to tell you about today. Everyone returned safely, teams of campers reported on the radio that they had everything in order. Crazy cat baffled dozen zombies, because of what they gnawed each other. However, he did not survive the turmoil himself. We took a couple of tents for the guests, but <span class="tid_user tid_user_1797494 tid_userBg tid_userFriend tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1797494">Joanne</span> refused on the pretext that used to sleep under the open sky. <span class="tid_user tid_user_1757235 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1757235">Sashimi</span> stated that necessarily will take part in tomorrow's briefing and, if needed, will stay here with <span class="tid_user tid_user_3988087 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="3988087">Blaire</span> for another day. Is it even possible to refuse her offers?</p>

                <p>Hey comrades.</p><p>This is a disaster. 8-10 readers is totally not the thing I am going to work for. I want to see at least <strong>50</strong>.<br>Asking for too much? Nope. Make a simple calculation: I am working my ass out, 1 chapter takes near 20 hours from me writing, translating and redacting. Reading this chapter takes not more than 15 minutes. So 20*60/15=80. So actually after <strong>100</strong> readers I will feel that everything was not in vain… I even divided it by 2, taking in mind that this is just a fan story and not my native language. In Russian I can easily reach that numbers, so making this story “just for myself” is like making a step back.<br>Why it is so? Everyone who reads it cheers me up, but this number is too low. I can not even make any conclusions what I am doing wrong, can only guess. I will not dwell on the subject.<br>I thought a lot about that situation. I have another projects in mind and RL stuff to do. So I will better switch to them, and will not be able to spend 2-3 exhausting writing days of “War of Metas” like I did before. This is not worth it. <br>But! I love the story myself, and dropping projects is not in my style. And actually the main action and ideas are gonna happen in 4th and 5th chapters, abandoning the project before I will reach that main idea will not be good. So I will write 4th chapter just to see if the change in storyline will fix the situation. But I will work on it in “relax mode”, spending not more than 1-2 hours a day on writing, so you can make your own calculations how long it will take.</p><p>tl;dr: day 4 will be posted only at the start of November in the best case.</p>
