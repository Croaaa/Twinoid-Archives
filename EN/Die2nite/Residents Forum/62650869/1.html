                <p><strong><em>WARNING! <br>LONG, NOVEL-LENGTH, "TL: DR" POST UPCOMING!</em></strong></p><br><p>Okay... so..<br>...there exist metas in this game. Quite a few of them.</p><p>First of all, does anyone know how many are still active? How about how many have gone away or are currently defunct?<br>How many are there are TOTAL, does anyone really know?</p><p>Okay, let me try.</p><p>First of all, there is, in my mind....THE KING of metas: <strong>6FO</strong>.</p><p>Now, <strong>6FO</strong> has a glorious history. Originally it was stared by a player named <span class="tid_user tid_user_1829055 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1829055">Damoksta</span> and it had the name <strong>DoBFoS</strong>. What that stood for, I never knew, but I was invited to it early on and was a member of it for about a year, or one full season (a little of season four and a little of season five), then I stopped playing.</p><p>When I came back, about a year and a half later... <strong>DoBFoS</strong> was now <strong>6FO</strong> (which, I still don't know what it stands for...does anyone know), and is now mostly managed by great planner <span class="tid_user tid_user_70794 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="70794">Dream</span>. I was invited a few times again... and jumped with them 4-5 times, maybe.... but then I found a meta that was much more relaxed....</p><p>This was <strong>ZOA</strong>.... which stands for.. uh.. Zombies.. something something.<br>So, <strong>ZOA</strong>...a second meta I can name. This one was run by a fellow named <span class="tid_user tid_user_1418336 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1418336">Embacie</span> with a little help from the grand <span class="tid_user tid_user_1828853 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1828853">UrsulaK</span>. I was with <strong>ZOA</strong> for almost two years. It was great. To this day, that meta was one of the most accepting, understanding, greatest metas I have played with. It was kind of a "teaching" meta and accepted pretty much anyone, as long as they weren't a troll or greifer. A newbie willing to learn? Sure! Come join <strong>ZOA</strong>. We had a lot of good, strong, smart, and experienced players play regularly with us, though... and we went pretty far a few times.</p><p><strong>ZOA</strong> eventually became less and less active, though...and soon, I had gotten an invite to jump and be a member of another meta, at the time: <strong>7Sins</strong>.</p><br><p>Ahhhhh, <strong>7Sins</strong>, what an awesome name for a meta. It stands for.. uh... well, like all the other meta initials, I couldn't tell ya. Maybe it just stood for what it says: 7 Sins (after the seven deadly sins).</p><p>Anyway, I jumped with <strong>7Sins</strong> two or three times... and it was mostly run and lead by a charming woman named <span class="tid_user tid_user_1757235 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1757235">Sashimi</span>. She was a very good planner, too...and very kind and friendly to all. <br>So that's three. <strong>7Sins</strong> was another meta, but I think they faded in activity, over time, too.</p><br><p>Meanwhile, during this time...well, there had always existed a meta I HEARD about, but never knew any members from. It was like a ghost meta. I never could quite meet or talk to any of the people in it. It was named <strong>INGSOC</strong>, and if ANY meta rivialed <strong>6FO</strong> over being the TOP meta, this one was it.<br>I had heard legendary tales of <strong>INGSOC</strong>, although, again, I had never talked to anyone from it or knew of anyone who was in it. it was like, the FREEMASONS or ILLUMINATI of metas.</p><p>However, since I had never had any experience with <strong>INGSOC</strong>, they just couldn't rise-in my mind-as being better than <strong>6FO</strong>, who I knew members and leader of PERSONALLY.</p><p>So, IMO (back in those days) <strong>6FO</strong> was the best, <strong>INGSOC</strong> was second, <strong>7SINS</strong> was third, and <strong>ZOA</strong> was at the end, trailing behind. This was "MY" insight, from what I had gleaned and experienced with playing with these groups.</p><p>By the way, <strong>INGSOC</strong>? Don't know what it stands for. That should be no surprise by now. I don't know what ANY of these groups stand for. :p Anyone care to enlighten?</p><p>It was only until later (much later) that I finally had the honor of meeting and talking to the wonderful leader, <span class="tid_user tid_user_4461983 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="4461983">Sinistra</span>. Turns out she isn't some huge, secret, elite leader.... but a very kind, smart, well-read, well-spoken person. Oh, I'm sure she has a "general" type side to her, too, when organizing and operating towns...<br>...but from the PMs I've exchanged with her, she's very nice.<br>She also invited me to jump with them...so, the day I do, I will jump for joy at being a person who has jumped with all four of the "BIG" metas: <strong>INGSOC, 6FO</strong>, <strong>7SINS</strong>, and <strong>ZOA</strong></p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><p>But wait... there's more. What about other metas? Do they exist? I'm betting they do...and, in fact, I know of at least three more. Three more that have seemingly started when I finally took a break again...this time FOR TWO YEARS. I could be wrong, though... they could have existed before them, but suffice to say, I had not heard of them before.</p><p>The first is <strong>SotA</strong>..which...HEY, I actually know what this one stands for, for once! It stands for "Sons of the Atom". Yep, you better capitalize that "A", lest <span class="tid_user tid_user_7225383 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="7225383">Schroedinger</span> get mad at you. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"><br><strong>SotA</strong> is filled, again, with really great and intelligent members, I find. I jumped with them a few times, once in a Christmas town (there were about half of them in there) that went past day 20...and another two times after that, with various members of it. Very steadfast, strong group.</p><br><p>And then there's one called <strong>CoS</strong>, apparently... but no idea what that stands for (no surprise,.. me not knowing what a meta name stands for should be a drinking game by now), but I don't think I know any of its members and I've never jumped with them.</p><p>And finally, we have a meta I have only heard the NAME about. <span class="tid_user tid_user_1437174 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1437174">fdamned26</span> told me about a meta named <strong>HIVE</strong>. I think <strong>HIVE</strong> might just be the NEWEST meta around, and I certainly don't know who is in it or what it stands for (DRINK!).</p><br><p>Anyway, as I said, I took another break, this time for TWO FREAKING YEARS.</p><p>I recently came back around last November.</p><p>Since then, I've learned a few things:<br><strong>6FO</strong> seems to be inactive, currently.<br><strong>7Sins</strong> seems to have disappeared.<br><strong>ZOA</strong> is still no more.</p><p>....and so, the new "TOP" meta (in my mind) becomes <strong>INGSOC</strong>. Current kings...going far almost every time.<br>Second to them is <strong>Sota</strong>....oops, sorry... I meant <strong>Sot<em>A</em></strong><br>And behind them are <strong>CoS</strong>, in third place, and <strong>HIVE</strong> in fourth.</p><br><br><br><br><p>Are these all of the metas? I'm thinking not. I know I must have missed or forgotten about 2 or 3.. or possibly even 6 or 7.<br>And who knows how many "small" ones there are.. or ones that are currently being built and made? I know some that are nameless, right now.....so I can't very well list them. I know <span class="tid_user tid_user_1835033 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1835033">Too_Ton</span> was trying to make another one...and I've got one I'm sorta with that is nameless and has members like <span class="tid_user tid_user_2080387 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="2080387">Ice_</span> and <span class="tid_user tid_user_1818507 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1818507">Deuteronomy</span> and <span class="tid_user tid_user_9754783 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="9754783">DevilFighter</span> and <span class="tid_user tid_user_9754788 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="9754788">RagingRhonda</span>...no idea who else is a part of their group, though.</p><p>Sometimes I wonder why all of the groups and metas don't just COMBINE into ONE, HUGE meta. Join forces and all that.... it would be pretty amazing... a huge force to be reckoned with.</p><p>I doubt that will ever happen, though....people tend to like to be independent and not all folks get along with one another. Difference in opinion in how the game is played and what to do can flare up, after all. Instead we have a ton of players who probably interact and jump with ALL metas from time to time. Seriously, how many metas have YOU been a part of, in your history? I'm betting- if you're a long time player who is also a hero- a LOT. Maybe you're like me and have been a member of ALL of these metas at one point or another.</p><br><br><br><br><br><p>But anyway, my point is.... there exists a lot of groups in this game, obviously..<br>...and I was just curious about how many there were and who they all are....an maybe to get some talk going about them. Maybe some stories..... History stories and town stories and maybe a roll call, of sorts, of WHO has been in WHAT before.</p><br><br><p>TO SUM UP, TL ; DR:</p><p>Metas in this game: <strong>6FO/DoBFoS, ZOA, 7SINS, HIVE, SoC, INGSOC, SotA</strong><br>More?</p>

                <p>As for past metas here's a few you missed and some you got but with the original leaders:</p><p>LS (lost souls) Packersfan<br>7sin (7 zedly sins) Gibslader<br>N&amp;C (Nicky &amp; company) Vertigoprocess<br>Unnamed Fodgycakes<br>RFM (royle flying mowers) Quent<br>Oozing Inn - McQuade<br>RWF (running with Fridges) 123YOudontknowme<br>WF (Wonder Fail) Sense<br>The Family - don't know<br>ZedEX - don't know<br>WCH (working class heroes) Miudo<br>TCO (the chosen ones) I'm just gonna say killerchess<br>shadow clan - don't know<br>Hippies (i guess) Joanne?</p><p>Some groups i know very little about and didn't seem to last to long.<br>Strange crows<br>Clucky bastards</p><p>I prob missed a few small ones... maybe a bigger one as well... it's been awhile since i tracked all the metas.</p><p>The big metas were Unnamed and RFM. These were the 2 always fighting for first, with Unnamed coming on top most of the time. Not far behind them was Oozing Inn. During their peek 7sins and LS would fight for spots below oozing inn and coming close (maybe sometimes beating) them.</p><p>So during this period of time I'd rank the metas as UNnamed&gt;RFM&gt;Oozing Inn&gt;LS&gt;7sins&gt;WF</p><p>As this age calmed down and LS and WF broke up and other metas started popping up, this is around the time CoS, N&amp;C, Ingsoc and WCH sprung up in full force. N&amp;C and INGSOC were always very close, both going from half metas to full metas at about the same time and running some meta mash ups together (we're talking pre Sinistra btw, who I found in a random town and then decided to join INGSOC over N&amp;C. Which i shall never forgive her for <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">).</p><p>6FO really didn't come onto the scene until way later. They improved fast with dream as the leader, but I'd say 100% Unnamed's peek rose far higher then 6FO's. 6FO also was unfortunate enough that when they started to peek the game started to die way more rapidly.</p><p>Also I wouldn't call Hive a meta, they were more like a group of players from a bunch of different metas coming together as the game died (but i guess that's just my opinion). I also don't think any of those players are still around for the most part.</p><p>As for CoS the remaining members play with INGSOC and there's only a few of them left (maybe one of them wants to speak for themselves though instead of me...).</p><p>INGSOC also has a good hand full of EX N&amp;C members as well as members from pretty much every former meta. But now are all just called INGSOC members. Even some of the EX N&amp;C members now in INGSOC were part of other metas before N&amp;C. It's just the nature of the game, a meta falls apart and the members all split off to new metas.</p><p>I started off with a simple list... this got way longer then I expected. This is also all from my prospective, so people may have seen these times different then me.</p>

                <p>I found this thread interesting, so I decided to go back through my messages from 2013-2013 (When i used to play).</p><p>The first Meta I was ever invited to is <strong>WCH</strong>, their organizer is/was <span class="tid_user tid_user_1397717 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1397717">Miudo</span> , I don't really know where they are now if they still exist.

                <p>This makes me regret how i never really tried to accomplish or be apart of anything in this game. I've played since Season 1 and i regret not getting involved and being an Obnoxious dickhead. Regardless i've always loved this game though.

Thx Chris and Vertigo, was a nice read <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I personally loved the times with damoksta and the other dobfos guys (the name came from the first towns: <strong>the districts of the burned</strong>, which was going truly awesome with many water buildings and stuff, but ended on day 12 because noone closed the gates <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_lol.gif" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">, the second town was <strong>Fell of surgeons</strong>, which was very cool, lasted long, but we were really unlucky, with no water building, and almost all random ppl dying pretty quick, therefor making the town unable to get on the leaderboard.) I remember we started getting bored in s4, mostly because when we were fighting for as long as we could, other towns discovered the lazy zombies bug (yes, I call it a bug), therefor reducing our chances for top to 0%.</p>

                <p>Well first of all I did say "(i guess)" when I listed hippies. Mostly for the points that you made. But you can also make the same argument about 6FO since they pretty much merged with RFM in later seasons.</p><p>The thing is in the later seasons (like the WAY later seasons) a lot of the top metas really started having their lines blur and it's really hard to point to a lot of of the top towns and say it was run by any one meta.</p><p>Just look at the roaster of the season 11 top town marked as a 6FO town. Idare is in there (last leader of RFM) Sashimi is in there (last leader of 7Sins) as well as a large amount of miscellaneous players from miscellaneous metas. Not trying to take away from Dream's accomplishments by any means since it's pretty clear he ran the town. But still the lines between metas at this point is pretty damn blurry since metas were just trying to cobble together whatever meta players were still left. Metas no long had set roasters at this point like they had in the past.</p><p>My point being... I don't really have one i just like talking about metas and it's really fun to look back after the fact at all this wonderful history we have in this game now that it's just about over.</p><p>Fortis did float but I do still say that he was primarily a Oozing Inn member and pretty much took over leadership of Oozing Inn later on (at least that's my understanding). Although Oozing Inn didn't really work based off a leader, it was more of a collaboration meta.</p><p>I also just want to point out a N&amp;C + INGSOC colab town took a very close second that same season in HC.</p>

He's always been pretty hands on with teaching people how to play (Workshop angrily told Fortis "this isn't carebear2nite" one time because of how friendly Fortis was, and Fortis ran with it and that's why his avatar is a care bear now). He was a Oozing inner dating back to at least season 4, so I wouldn't put much stock into WES being a real half-meta. Rather just a side shoot of Oozing Inn.</cite><p>It's funny to hear someone refer to Fortis as friendly <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":sq_happy:" class="tid_ico"> Blunt and to the point is more like it but he wasn't a douche either, he just wanted to do as well as he could, that was my view anyways (I do hope he doesn't read this <img src="../../../../gfx/square/confused.png" alt=":{" class="tid_ico">)</p><p>I thought the carebear2nite thing was, not for being friendly as such, but for trying to start a whole thing for teaching people how to play, I thought Workshop's stance was a bit more like "you need to get stuck in and learn for yourself- that's part of the die2nite experience. And to not be molly coddled by experienced players" But my memory is shit so I understand I may be wrong <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I thought Fortis' side project was something to do in between serious Oozing Inn towns, at least that's how it started, because usually The Oozing Inn would throw wonder towns in between ranking attempts for those that didn't need/want a break in between. Hence the name "Wasteland Escort Service and friends ranking hard" because he was hardcore into ranking, even when he's in between ranking attempts.</p><p>Neuroguy's still about he may be able to confirm or tell me I got it all wrong.</p><p>Gotta add, even though The Oozing Inn's leaders weren't explicitly stated as such, these are the ones I felt played a key roll in leadership at various times: Fortis, Bram, Mcquade, Viggo, UDBKing, as well as Neuroguy and Canyonero who'd protest at the title but both did really do a lot and I think deserve to have their names in the history book. Probably missed a few still.</p><p>Also, this thread totally reminded me of ValiumCereal and his meta <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"> I forgot about those crazy bastards, they were fun.</p>

There was no leader per se, giving out orders to everyone every day, as in, say, HIVE with <span class="tid_user tid_user_3697548 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="3697548">Jedermann</span> and <span class="tid_user tid_user_8087604 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8087604">Ivana</span> or unnamed and such, but someone would post general things to be done for the day. So, it wasn't very stressful and there were no repercussions if you didn't get something done. That is why I enjoy being in INGSOC now, as it's the same playing style, thanks to <span class="tid_user tid_user_4461983 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="4461983">Sinistra</span>.</p><p>I wasn't a leader in any sense of the word, I was just around a lot. I got into the Oozing Inn by accident. I had been floundering around in Season 2 getting nowhere in the game, then in my first town in Season 3 I blundered into their town. Someone (JimmieD) put a poisoned can in the bank for a joke as it wasn't a serious town, which I ate. I took it well, so they invited me to join.</p><p>As for <span class="tid_user tid_user_1760788 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1760788">Fortis</span>, he was a big part of the Oozing Inn for a long time. I knew he had side towns to help inexperienced players, but I didn't know there was a meta connected with it.</p><p><span class="tid_user tid_user_1001758 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1001758">McQuade</span> was the final head of the Oozing Inn for a few seasons when it just whithered away like most of the others.</p><p>Finally, let's not forget <span class="tid_user tid_user_1821144 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1821144">CrossKnights</span> who was also big in the OI at the time and made videos of towns which he posted on YouTube. This morphed into him doing "Let's Play" videos and his own channel which he still has. Look it up. He's pretty funny.</p>

                <p>This is the history of The Oozing Inn, as I remember it.</p><p>I gathered a coalition of good people in my last small map. Their names were Leuma, Higgins, tribaut, and saur. This was late season 1. I had accumulated 100 SP by the end of this town and we jumped into our first distant town together. The name of this town was The Oozing Inn.</p><p>In this town were Hynk, Trickpick, and Crossknights. All three helped lay the foundation. I was looking for a meta and I found a home with these awesome people. I remember tribaut being awestruck at landing in a town with CK. He was a celebrity even then.</p><p>We had fun struggling along as a half meta for a long time. Along the way we met people like McQuade(lrytaylor), rumata, b00t, Neuroguy, Viggo, Concerteena, SteveFrench (CrayolaPotts), samelite, Canyonero, JimmyD, JoeySin, ElleG, desertsniper, Ashenbear, UnkemptCube, Kilimanjaro, Relish, Hollowpoint, Alicya...</p><p>I'm missing plenty for sure.</p><p>It was some point around the first Clash of the Titans that I was being recruited by RFM. Fortis interviewed me. It was intimidating haha <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> He was already a pretty famous player by then. And RFM was like a call up to the big leagues. That is what it felt like. You have to understand, getting into a big meta was a pretty amazing thing back in the day of season 3/4 wild west 20 or so half-metas, of which the OI was one.</p><p>We got along very well. Long story short, Fortis ended up joining The Inn instead of me joining RFM. (Though I did guest with RFM a time or two and this relationship helped to forge a close partnership). I couldn't leave my people. RFM and OI partnered in the cross-server competition however, an probably a couple of times afterwards? There is a picture out there somewhere of me flexing my meager muscles with a flying lawnmower on one bicep and an oozing inn on the other.</p><br><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/58354254@N06/5596308433/in/photostream/">This</a> is an image of the Oozing Inn map.

I have no idea what's on the FAS group, but i have screenies from a town Fortis and Workshop were together and where their first disagreements begun.</p><p>It was pretty dumb, actually. The town was called Plaines of hades in Season 7. It was a mix of Coalition of Stares + Oozing Inn. I think me and WS were both stalkers of the town. Workshop was no longer playing with Unamed and begun his lone wolf quest for LMS and pictos.</p><p>So yeah, at some point he complained that some player from OI joined the same zone he was ASing and- oh well just read it:<br><a href="https://i.imgur.com/g7TH07y.png" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/g7TH07y.png</a><br><a href="https://i.imgur.com/LMhL7H5.png" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/LMhL7H5.png</a><br><a href="https://i.imgur.com/QFz3piV.png" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/QFz3piV.png</a></p><p>alright, here Fortis came in defense of that dude, i coulnt find the screenie of what he posted, but he pointed out some of the things WS was doing lately which were summed up into selfish play. To which WS replied:</p><p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/T9c1rJf.jpg" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/T9c1rJf.jpg</a></p><p>Then there was more debate and yada yada and then this:<br><a href="https://i.imgur.com/Ggz0DL0.png" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/Ggz0DL0.png</a></p><p>This encounter generated the debate about carebear2nite and that group and many things you guys can still find if you go and forum search.</p><p>Personally i don't really care and i think no one should bother revisit this. Both are no longer playing this game. Workshop even deleted his account. They were both right; Fortis defending his meta member an Workshop, with his experience as a member of the best meta there was, was just trying to help. What happened was that WS lost his composure and it went nasty.</p><p>And for someone that might think i'm posting here to make him look bad. Just chill. I just need to OCD-fix wrong stuff people say when they say. It isn't personal.</p>

                <p>That's fascinating stuff, Miudo. Thank you for posting it. I wasn't in that town for some reason. Cannot remember why, must have been some previous commitment. But I sure heard a whole lot about it.</p><p>The way that I recall it, Workshop was invited to the town as a guest of the Inn, which does color things somewhat. At least in my mind. Also, the name RonnieOSullivan did not ring a bell for me. Just took a quick glance at his soul and he appears to have been a CoS member, and not an Innkeeper. Fortis was not defending a meta teammate, but was acting on principle I believe. Not trying to argue, just offering a perspective.</p><p>As a somewhat (maybe) interesting side-note to this, you will see that Grothendieck, an on-again, off-again member of the Inn for several years, is mentioned in the last image you posted. I know that Grothy was supportive of Workshop through this episode. After the town was over he was discussing it with myself and a few others (maybe Neuroguy and Undeadburgerking I think) in our old chatroom. I told him that I supported Fortis, but that it didn't matter anyway because what done was done. But he wouldn't let it go and just kept ranting about it.

                <p>This was an interesting read to be sure. The one thing that Bram forgot about the history of the Oozing Inn is that the town we got our name from had a griever in it. Anti (I'm not sure how you guys are doing that fancy profile linking thing) opened the gates a minute before the attack on day two, killing six people including almost my entire coalition before killing himself. The fact that we were able to make it so far after an attack like that was part of what brought us together.</p><p>The seasons before Clash were my favorite. We would go into a town, and out of the whole town there were usually 1 or 2 people that were awesome who we would invite to join us. It made sure we had people we knew we could work with and would enjoy talking to. Playing this game had a lasting impact on my life too. I had just gotten out of college and had a graphic design job but didn't really interact with too many people in real life at that point. Basically, I talked to Inn members more than I talked to anyone in real life for a while beside my co-workers. The conversations we had helps keep me a little bit more sane in my post-college transition.</p><p>What's really crazy though is that if Anti's zombies decided to kill me I may have never joined the Inn. If they killed even more people the Inn may never even have been formed. My life would have been pretty different if that it happened. Cube and Hollowpoint are Inn Keepers that I'm still friends today. Hell I was just playing Heroes of the Storm with them a few hours ago. We formed a little internet gaming group of video makers and streamers that has been together for over half a decade now. That's possible that none of it ever would have happened if the random number generator had been a little bit less forgiving.</p><p>It's crazy to think how such little things can have such a profound impact on life's trajectory.</p>
