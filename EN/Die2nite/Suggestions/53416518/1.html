Include a "bank manager" role to the bank who can approve bank requests. Deposits are unnecessary. Make the add-on work so that if the town doesn't build it, everything stays how it is. Bank manager should have the ability to give out special permissions.

                <p>Let me tell you something. We cleared a great deal of the map, there's some long range zones, most active town I've seen between Season 9 and 12. Literally, most of the town is scavenging, there's no need to build anything, it's day 3. There isn't even enough people in town able to complaint this guy. He literally dropped half of the town's materials outside the town, consumed 70% of everything he could etc. All because he's grieving over having become infected.</p><p>Now lets say you actually consume drugs in life. Anyone who overdoses is either immobilized, goes into coma, gets poisoned, vomits, dies etc. You go down, no matter how big you are.</p><p>Stage 1 - Clean or used drug<br>Stage 2 - Addicted<br>Stage 3 - Immobilized or dead</p><p>Makes total sense if you think about it.</p><p>1) Stops total destruction of town property<br>2) Prevents a single player from doing everything (Builds teamwork)<br>3) Places more emphasis on cooperation, less on solo let's kill this town, trolling, grieving nonsense<br>4) Preserves peace</p><p>Bank Lock doesn't do anything for you when nobody is around for several hours. 5 complaints against the player in 3 hours when everyone's off probably sleeping. Think the guy found a way to kill himself or someone killed him somewhere. There's a lot of destruction that can happen when 1 person can basically do whatever they want. This aspect of the game should have something to fight it back.</p>

                <p>You're missing the point by comparing game features with RL effects. I don't even have to get started to show the purpose is not to mimic a RL experience, unless you think someone can walk dozens of miles every day eating a dish of food and sleeping 15 minutes a day (assuming you're not a watchmen that day).</p><p>That being said, onwards to the implications of your suggestion:</p><p><em>1)</em> The game is <em>designed</em> to allow such abuses, it's meant to contain possibilities of foul playing and corresponding means to fight back. The introduction of ghouls leave it blatant.</p><p><em>2)</em> No player can do "everything" on the game. It may look this way when you face a griefer consuming drugs but he will end up hooked and can die on the next day if the consume all the drugs</p><p><em>3)</em> There's no game that is more based on cooperation than this one. Alone you can't do literally nothing to stop the town from dying early. And we're back to the point that trolling, selfish play and grieving are intented to happen, and there are means to counter any of those actions</p><p><em>4)</em> If you want peace random towns aren't the place you're looking for. They're chaotic and as you witnessed takes just one jackass to screw the whole thing. And they're meant to be that way. If your town can't organize 8 people among 39 to shun the guy in 24 hours, believe me: the town is doomed from scratch and there's no way you're making it till day 18 like you said before.</p><p>That being said, understand this:<br>The drug consumption system is <strong>very</strong> important to perform some tasks, such as:</p><p><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_arrow.gif" alt=":hordes_fleche:" class="tid_ico"> Allow catapult operator to work properly<br><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_arrow.gif" alt=":hordes_fleche:" class="tid_ico"> Explore the further corners of map without a very organized town with tight planning<br><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_arrow.gif" alt=":hordes_fleche:" class="tid_ico"> Long range scouting with a hooked scout<br><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_arrow.gif" alt=":hordes_fleche:" class="tid_ico"> Massive building using drugs (mainly unlabelleds) on mid-game to help a town to complete an important defensive building and/or a wonder in time before town collapses<br><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_arrow.gif" alt=":hordes_fleche:" class="tid_ico"> Several collecting missions that are crucial for organized towns</p><p>There are others but I'm sure you got the point, which is: there's no need to chance a balanced, important and <strong>very</strong> useful game aspect just because one or another dickhead messed up a random town. As I said, shun/hang/eat him and if the damage can't be repaired, suicide and join another town.<br>And if you wanna experience the game at it's full potential, and even to learn and understand better some features and mechanics that it has, join a organized town.</p>

                <p>The game is broken if 1 player can consume 15 drugs or 2000 drugs and not die from overdose. The game's concept is based on a realistic atmosphere or in other words, this game's fantasy is based on real-life examples. That's why you use wood and metal to build shit, consume food and water for energy and survival, and consume too many drugs to become addicted.</p><p>There are others who've encountered this abuse and there isn't a whole lot that can be done to fight against it, just punch the guy and hope you kill him or if you're lucky enough to become a ghoul, eat the bastard. I'm merely encouraging the developers to take another look at the game again from this angle. You don't have to, I don't expect you to. You didn't watch 3 hours of this prick going in and out of town, converting materials, constructing, consuming and taking the town's inventory to dump it in the wasteland.</p><p>I understand there are elements in place to "counter" such acts. There are elements of this game that'll be affected by it that may go above and beyond my understanding of a deeper element but there's 1 thing that remains absolutely true - If I want to play like a total prick, I should consume anything and everything to hurt everyone in the town, not out of grief, but out of my designed right to play solo how I want to play based on your logic.</p><p>If we assume the game's concept is based on a real-life example like so many "designed features" the game has already offered, this over-dosing drug consuming concept would not be possible, therefore, it would not happen if properly addressed.</p>

Everything that increases communication and coordination is good.).</p><p>If you expect "black sheep" to be in town, start safeguarding drugs in chests.</p><p>The game is designed to allow egoistic play, and one person can (unless already in chaos mode) only take 5 items every 15 minutes from the bank. Either prevent this from happening in advance by safeguarding or shun the guy in time.</p><p>And stop comparing D2N with real life and using these comparisons as arguments - it's nice to immerse into the game universe like you apparently do, and unavoidable to be disturbed by certain things there, but that doesn't mean they are more important than game design and balance.</p>

                <p>Thats the thing. The town had zero issues, 95% of everyone used forum. There was no way to know this guy was going to act out as he did. It was like 10:30pm EST, most everyone was either out or asleep so there just wasn't anything that could be done to prevent the guy. Someone recommended if it happens anytime in any game send the items to other players, which I clearly didn't think about.</p><p>Gonna continue comparing D2N to real life, thank you.

I'll be honest, I don't know what you think you're seeing in my town but you are admitting that you're seeing there is something has been done. That's all that matters.</p><p>3) The context of what I've brought here is not at all exaggerated. I never specified exact amounts. If all you can see is what is in bank during these days but not where people are while they were scavenging those days, what they brought in, what the player used, what he took out, what he dumped in desert, what actually happen, where he dumped stuff, and how long this all took, you clearly still don't know anything at all, do you?</p><p>4) Opinions like yours are more than welcome here, just as mine are and I'll stand by that. I might not have been as lucky as you to live 38 days in any town I've ever played but the suggestion is still just as viable now as it was when I first started the thread. I've played games like this for half my life, maybe longer now, I've lost track and I know that whoever's developing the game is the only person(s) I need to convince (Just between us, that's if they ever are lucky enough to read suggestions from their community).</p><br><p>Call it ranting, if you like. I don't care if I get banned for speaking my mind, I'll still believe taking drugs 3 times or more in a single day should come at a chance of something - death, paranoia, injury, coma even if it doesn't just outright kill you. That's why there's suggestion threads. This isn't about taking away a player's right to damage a town, it's about adding things that I believe should be in the game. For that, I'm absolutely not wrong.</p>

The game's concept is based on a realistic atmosphere or in other words, this game's fantasy is based on real-life examples.

I'm merely encouraging the developers to take another look at the game again from this angle. You don't have to, I don't expect you to.

There are elements of this game that'll be affected by it that may go above and beyond my understanding of a deeper element but there's 1 thing that remains absolutely true - If I want to play like a total prick, I should consume anything and everything to hurt everyone in the town, not out of grief, but out of my designed right to play solo how I want to play based on your logic.</p><p>If we assume the game's concept is based on a real-life example like so many "designed features" the game has already offered, this over-dosing drug consuming concept would not be possible, therefore, it would not happen if properly addressed.</p></cite><p>Thats like sayin' that the movie E.T. isn't based on the human imagination, and that the movies broken because he makes a bike fly, it's NOT real just like die2nite...</p>
