                <p>Here's something that slightly bugs me. It doesn't come up very often, but when it does, it's just mildly annoying.</p><br><br><p>So it's Day 8 or 10 or 12, okay? And this isn't a meta town or anything like that. In fact, it's a town that's fairly crappy and only 10-14 are left alive.</p><br><p>So I start to build up my house, make it stronger.</p><p>I take heed to use my "second wind" power (for the six AP needed to build a hovel ) and my "lucky find" power (for the plank and iron needed for a shack/house).</p><br><p>And then someone starts a discussion forum topic about how I'm "wasting AP and resources".</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><p>....What? <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/huh.png" alt=":tid_huh:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Pardon me? <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt=":tid_dontcare:" class="tid_ico"></p><br><br><p>First of all, I got the six AP needed for my hovel from my SECOND WIND power. That's MY power that I get from being a hero and I'm free to do with the AP whatever I want to do.</p><p>I can see and understand someone getting mad if I'm wasting NORMAL AP (AKA, AP you get normally each day, or from drinking, or from eating)....but THIS AP, the "Second Wind" AP is AP that town should <strong>NEVER EXPECT TO HAVE</strong> (in my opinion). If I wasn't a hero, then I wouldn't be able to put that AP to better use either, because it wouldn't even exist then....don't tell me I'm wasting AP when that's my personal, perk of being a hero AP.</p><p>If it's a meta town or a MMJ town or a town that has promise of going far and doing well...then, yes, I'll gladly even put my bonus AP into other stuff..<br>..but when the town is already winding down and not going to get any better than it is and it's been like that for a few days... don't accuse me of wasting AP. I'm free to use that AP however I want.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><p>And then we have the whole "wasting resources" accusation. <br>Uh, no, that was my hero power too. I USED MY POWER TO FIND THAT PLANK AND THAT IRON OUT OF THIN AIR....</p><p>...<strong>AND you even got ONE EXTRA OUT OF THE DEAL, since that package finds THREE things.</strong> So if anything, you should be thanking me.</p><p>Again, that is my hero perk power and it's stuff you'd never have even had otherwise if I wasn't one.<br>If I'm taking stuff out of the bank that others found, and using that stuff, then YES, I can be seen as wasting resources....but this is MY power. How is it wasting resources? I could have <em>DIED WITHOUT USING IT</em>...would it have been wasting resources then? I could have <em>RAN OUT OF HERO DAYS BEFORE USING IT</em>...it wasting resources then? <em>I COULD NOT HAVE THAT HERO POWER UNLOCKED YET</em>...is it wasting resources then? <em>I COULD HAVE JUST NEVER USED IT AT ALL</em>...since I don't ever use all of my hero powers in a town. It wasting resources then?<br>No?<br>Well then just pretend I NEVER USED IT. <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt=":tid_dontcare:" class="tid_ico"></p><br><br><br><p>Anyway, I just needed to vent. Maybe I'm the one in the wrong here. Maybe it IS and CAN still be taken as being selfish.</p><p>But just to be (more) clear, I'm not talking about doing any of this in the first 8 days (or so)...or doing it if there are more than 15 people still alive.<br>I'm talking about times like right now...when there's about 12 left alive and it's day 10. <br>When it's that far along and I build a precious hovel or shack...don't accuse me or say I've been wasting AP or resources when I've been TRYING NOT TO by using my own personal power reserves.</p><br><p>I don't care who you are, second wind power is <strong>NOT ANY AP THAT ANY TOWN SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED TO HAVE.</strong></p>

                <p>Seriously, the this "home upgrades are bad blabla" came up before blueprints were introduced. We didn't have projects like community involvement and an other attack system: Pretty much "if the attack is to high, you're fucked" and either town died or we started camping. High personal defence only increased chances to get the LMS and was just selfish and if you were planning on camping, it was pointless.</p><p>The whole thing is - like mentioned - about communication though: I'd even build a hovel on day 2, a shack on day 3 and a house on day 4, if I knew, I coouldn't be active on those days and had not enough AP to build them on other days, scavenging,... <br>As long as the AP ressources aren't needed to finish the building, that would save the town, everything is fine. Just explain it on the forums. However, try not to argue like the AP were your ressources, but with other reasons: You can't AS, because you have to work long/won't be home to get in that day, you had luck playing cards, guitar,... and just enough AP to build a shack and there was no point in dumping AP in the Great Pit or Portal Lock,...</p>
