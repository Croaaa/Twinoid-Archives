                <p>hey guys, odds are this has already been suggested in some form, but i figured it's worth mentioning regardless, see if it strikes up a discussion.</p><p>i'm hoping some of the devs will see this / other players will voice their support for the idea.</p><p>i think there should be some sort of system in place to file complaints against inactive citizens, and after say 3 complaints, that account is disabled for a month (or even like a week the first time, a month the second, and 6 months - a year if they're stupid enough to receive a third strike).</p><p>this is essentially a means for the community to police itself, and remove lazy / selfish / absentee citizens from the equation (albeit temporarily, but hopefully the inconvenience and embarrassment are enough of a deterrent for crappy players to smarten up or stay away).</p><p>phrased differently, i'm sick and tired of dieing on day 3 because out of 40 people, only 18 of them are active, and 3 of THEM are selfish / trolling / intentionally sabotaging communities.</p><p>how long do you think that kinda BS would be tolerated during a REAL crisis? that's right, just long enough to either take their crap and banish them, or take their crap and cook them for dinner.</p><p>thoughts / suggestions / glaringly obvious solutions that i'm not aware of?<br>this isn't about my fragile little ego, this is about a handful of immature / lazy jerks ruining an otherwise awesome game for the other players!</p><p>EVERY.<br>SINGLE.<br>TIME.</p>

                <p>as i told you in the other thread you need to join a meta to avoid running into inactive players.</p><p>first there is a name for what you are experiencing: its called random towns. <br>in random towns there are all kinds of players including the usual 10 to 20 silent players who never talk and some times die from dehydration.</p><p>you idea is a bad one and will never be considered because the inactivity is part of the game , you join a town with 39 others and hope those 39 work with you for your own personal goals , but you cant always get what you want because those 39 other players in random towns also are free to do anything they want, they can help and be active or be passive and do nothing you want them to do or even in some cases do things which are considered selfish and go against your own personal goals. that is all how this game is designed to be played. and there are manywho like this aspect of the game and handle it just fine.</p><p>so there will never be any banning or strike systems for players not doing what you want to feed your needs to have fun in this game. there are things in this game which are all allowed and part of the game which include someone eating another player and with it killing another citizen who even pays money to play, some can poison food or water and trick others to use those rations to be murdered. there are strategies which are 100% allowed and part of the game that allow other citizens to punch you so you can get infection and die next few days so they can increase their chances to get Last Man standing to win hero days. even closing the gates locking up to 39 people outside to die is allowed. and there are sooo many other things any player can do that could piss off the entire rest of town and it is all allowed and part of the game. this is the other side of Die2nite which bothers but you cant get rid of it.<br> <br>now if that frustrates you but you still like this game and want to keep playing, there is a loophole which few players who want perfect organized and team working towns have found to form a group called "meta" which is simply gathering from 20 to 30 players who all share same interest and play style to all form coalitions. each coalition has 5 players in it and they can form up to 8 coalition with 5 in each. that makes 40 players.<br>and when those 8 coalitions want to join a new town all they need to do to be in the exact same town is to join into a new empty town at the exact same time to land in the same town.with that they will guarantee having no inactive players or selfish players and can work as a team to really play this game in a way where you can reach the maximum of success and fun.</p><p>NOW there are also Events you can join where all active players all join on a set date and time into new distant towns to make sure all towns formed on that day are active with the majority. this is called MMJ (mass Meta Jump)</p><p>so do not bother in Â´suggesting such harsh unrealistic punishments for what is allowed in the rules of this game and instead search for a team to join so you can experience what you are looking for.</p><p>and you cant mistake the fact that there are not many people who enjoy the exact opposite play style as you. you would be surprised what some players prefer. and that must be respected because the game allows killing and selfishness and abandonment as long as teamwork and smart strategy play.</p><p>in 8 days there is an event being organized for the entire community to join at the same time to form several mass meta towns so if you have interest in that feel free to check it out and sign up here <a href="/tid/forum#!view/61490|thread/55760799?p=1" target="_self">[Event] Live2gether, Die Alone, Sep 11th</a></p><p>after that look for metas in the <a href="/tid/forum#!view/61490|thread/54919343" target="_self">Recruitment Thread</a></p>

                <p>Ok, develooers would never start banning people for inactivity.</p><p>Also, because you have less than 100 you are in "small town", a town where only noobs, first time players and experienced players can't join there without being a hero.</p><p>In a distant towns, players over 100 soul points, full inactivity amount drops a lot. There are not many people dehydrating at same time. Selfishness and smaller inactivity still occurs, but worst selfish players are shunned usually fast and small inactivity is not that big problem.</p><br><p>I think you should join to event Dream posted here, get some nice tips how to play like a pro, get rare distinctions and big pile of soul points.</p>

                <p>What you are suggesting is already a thing. But you are dealing with the wrong kind of "players" actually.</p><p>The ones you are encountering are not even players. It's just people that joined the game, didn't like what they saw, and will never return again.</p><p>Some of them die on day 1. Those that went out.</p><p>Most of them die on day 4. Dehydration.</p><p>Another share die on day 5. The ones that used their water on day 1.</p><p>You are bound to find 20-25 "players" like that on each Small Map town you go. Unfortunately there is nothing much we can do to repair this. It was suggested many times that we get a better starting tutorial, or some sort of feature that will put those away-from-life people into auto-pilot... to not harm the ones that do care to play the game.</p><p>The developers and current managers of this game do not care about this because:</p><ul><li>this is not the main game. The french version is.</li><li>there is still sufficient revenue from the current player base of veteran players.</li><li>you don't see the authors of this game advertising it outside the platform. Which means they are satisfied with how things are already.</li></ul><p>Now when it comes to real players, there are some game mechanics that prevent inactive players to join a town.</p><p>For example, the mechanic that put people into Unavailable status on the coalition when they don't connect to the game for 4-5 days. This is to prevent other players from the coalition to drag that inactive person to a town.</p><p>When you reach the Distant Regions you will still find players that slack-off. However, as matsuu said, its like 1 or 2 per town.</p><p>If you do want more activity to the point of turning this game into some sort of Action game, that will take most of your time, then you should follow Dream's suggestion and attempt to join a meta.</p><p>Otherwise, floppy-disk dude, posting suggestions like yours is as effective as making forum posts for those away-from-life people</p>
