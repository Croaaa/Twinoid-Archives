                <p>I know it might sound dumb and maybe impossible to add to the game, but imagine if you could assemble radios (and things like that) and put them in the zones and buildings around the map to lure away and distract the zombies during the attack (buildings can have extra bonus and the farther away the more bonus) like each radio you place will lure away 1% to 3% of the zombies (and off course there's a chance of failing) and to make it more hardcore each radio you place today will have 1.5% to 4.5% penalty tomorrow + the specific zone will have lots of zombies in it.</p><p>maybe somebody has already suggested this or it's already in the game but i don't know how to use it... i don't know...</p><p>thoughts?</p>
