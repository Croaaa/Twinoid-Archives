tid_id="70794">Dream</span>]<br><strong><em>here are some informations discovered so far about Souls and shaman in season 11:<br></em></strong><br><strong>How does the shaman get sellected?</strong></p><ul><li>in each new town the shaman get sellected on Day 2. and each time the current shaman dies the next day a new shaman will be sellected as the new shaman. this also means each town can only have one shaman at all times. <br>its 100% random for now, we tried to find any kind of connection to who may get sellected (twice after having the first shaman suicide) according to activity, first to log in on previous day or current day, lowest and highest activity, hero or resident, all of this had nothing to do with who got sellected a new shaman. here is the RP that will be shown in the gazette <a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/ec52225fcfc80f9dc7cd466829ee057c.png">here</a> and then <a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/f64f65599f41a7cb1730a0bd296f4414.png">here</a> for the second time<strong>What are The Forms a Soul can take:</strong></li></ul><p>each time a town has a death, a soul gets generated BUT the way of dying decides which form the souls will take:</p><br><ul><li>if someone dies <strong><em>inside</em></strong> the town as a watchmen, dehydration, withdrawl or eaten by zeds then a Blue <strong><em>Lost Soul (broken)</em></strong> will be generated in the desert next day. <a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/9a99c05e696d4ae442d4750c7e7d6b7d.png">Lost Soul (broken) look like this</a>. it is completely safe for anyone of any class shaman or not to pick up this types of souls without any need for an immunity from potions. they are harmless when picked up. and <a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/cbacba678ce6803dc88d39121eab4fb4.png">here</a> they remain Broken with a visible red box around the icon to show that they are simply broken like any other weapon and need a repair-kit to get them repaired.</li><li>if someone dies <strong><em>outside</em></strong> or fail to survive camping then a Red <strong><em>Tortured Soul</em></strong> will be generated in the desert next day. <a target="_blank" href="http://embed.gyazo.com/3367e94b6fa751fe833742fc234e304f.png">Tortured Soul look like this </a> <br>this Form of Souls will kill the citizen which will attempt to pick them up immediately as if it was a poison. <br>BUT there are 2 Ways to avoid this death by either</li><li>letting the shaman pick them up which will be immune to their effect because of the shamanic power, OR</li><li>letting any non-shaman citizen Drink a so called Mystic Potion or Shamanic Potion which can be made by the shaman in his home using 1 Soul Action and 1 water <a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/ce115d94bf5a86bc85e8be01f5e0a3e4.png">like this</a> and the person drinking it will become immune for <strong><em>the entire length of that town (not just 1 day)</em></strong> and allow him/her to pick any tortured Soul safely. here is the message you get Drinking the <a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/4e37b99f0884c8e1babb00aa45706ece.png"> Mystic Potion</a> and here is the message you get when you successfuly pick up a tortured Soul while being immune <a target="_blank" href="http://embed.gyazo.com/bb585008efd6fa6ccf396e5e679ff17f.png">here Picking up a red tortured Soul</a><br>THEN once the red tortured Soul is in the bank Anyone in town <a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/4efcae029314b93f446bc19985c22d52.png">can touch the Red Tortured Soul in town from bank safely WITHOUT the need for drinking a Mystic Potion.</a> Red Tortured Souls are only dangerous to pick up outside!!!<strong>Why does each town get a shaman and what can this Skill/class Do and why it is one of the most important Job in each town?</strong></li></ul><p>A Shaman can see all souls regardless of their current FORM at all times even after they have been picked up and dropped again . they will be hovering in a square of 4 zones, and the Soul will always be in the lower right zone of that square. the shaman can see the souls under unvisited zones so it is no longer needed to open the entire map by walking through all zones as it was the case in previous seasons.<br><a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/cd72cfe349d3523118c3a7a8fdb40aec.png">shaman can see the souls under unvisited zones</a></p><p>once the shaman gets sellected on day 2 he/she will have daily <a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/c9e65c5f9c4c0d37571428e657ce08ac.png">5 Soul Action Points</a> and here is what the shaman can do with them:</p><br><ul><li><a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/b3a69ce4217b79a97fc6bf8e5b1134ff.png">Making it Rain</a> to either kill zeds or if used at the towns Gates it has a % chance to add about 5 water to the well. and this action costs 3 Soul action points which means it can be done only once daily.</li><li><a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/ce115d94bf5a86bc85e8be01f5e0a3e4.png">Brew a Shamanic Potion</a> this requires 1 Soul Action Point and 1 water and it can be done up to 5 times daily. as explained before this potion must be drank as a replacment for daily water when a non-shaman needs to pick up and collect a red tortured Soul to avoid immediate death and become immune for <strong><em>the entire length of that town (not just 1 day)</em></strong>. and a reminder if you drink this Mystic Potion you will regain 6 normal AP and refreshed status , BUT at the cost of no longer being able to drink water again to regain another 6 AP. so its a simple exact replacment for water except giving the bonus immunity against tortured Souls.</li><li>shaman can pick up turtured Souls without any risk for death or the need for drink a mystic Potion and they are the only person in each town

I really don't get why you still don't admit it. no one expects random towns to last 15-20 days. but even the crappiest among them used to last 8-10 days, now they barely live to day 5-6.</p><p>as you noticed, most newbies don't want to follow orders or read the forums at the beginning, but lots of them start to do so when town lasts a bit (this usually happens close to day 5 or so). that's why recent changes screwed random towns big time. newbies (stubborn or clueless ones) get killed before they even get to know how the game works.</p><p>I'm in a small town now with 90% of real newbie players, and they'll all be dead before town develops minimally for they to start understanding game mechanics and what to do daily. And one of the only skilled there besides me is dying today as he got stuck on a building and can't run/camp or count on help of inactive newbie resis.</p><p>the randomly selectec shaman and new soul mechanics may be a somewhat cool innovation for metas or semi-organized towns (such as MMJ or the ones with at least 10 skilled players), but a bullet in the head for all others.</p>

                <p>I have to agree with kO13 here. while I do find this new shaman mechanic interesting it does basically wipe out town much faster now.</p><p>inless your in a town were only 1-3people die a day for the first couple days then your town can probley go onto day10 plus. the problem with this is most random towns aren't so lucky and with the upped attacks now thanks to the souls that most people usually don't pick up. towns survival is down to 50%-75% of what it used to be.</p>

                <p>Well Random town players usually are solo players playing for themselves and ignoring forums and everything else .</p><p>I have been trying to teach newbies for quite some time , used to do allot of helping and explaining in PMs of what they did wrong and how they could improve . Well result is clear - over 50% ignores everything, even PMs . Around 10% gives you a complait for sending a PM and if that PM points too much of what they did wrong you are certain to get a complaint or even get attacked .<br>Got attacked few times , had 7 complaints in around 5 random towns (strange that no one gave 8th and that i still have 0 shuns) . Pretty much gave up on helping after a long struggle ...</p><p>Compare any season , random towns don't last long , but they can last 10~ days if people try even a little and won't even last 5 days if people are ignorant .</p><p>Small towns ? Ye they get affected by updates like no camping or shamans quite a bit . <br>But lets admit it , if there are few players that want to learn and get to know the game they can last 5 days no problem and thats around the same what they usually last in every season .</p>

                <p>ahhh ok thanks ruint , i get what you have in mind.</p><p>just to make the idea more complete and realistic here are few points to know:<br>helping random towns involves Full Meta Players (Heroes as you intended) skipping few jumps with thier metas to help random towns. and lets be very honest here: those towns can be VERY frustrating for a meta player:<br>An actual help to random towns is to do things none of the randoms take the initiative to do or they Don´t have the knowledge like:</p><ul><li>you post in forum A LOT</li><li>PM messages in twinoid for mission requests</li><li>provide detailed daily Plans and strategies and explianing very patiently when someone has questions</li><li>keep correcting common mistakes left and right for all without sounding bossy or remain as friendly and polite as possible.</li><li>try to teach some facts and basics about the game</li><li>deal with hot heads who are aggressive and only think about shunning and hanging and have no clue what is justified as worth shunning but they consider it as a solution. (this is a huge problem because there are tuns of those in random towns and its almost impossible to reason with them, i honestly freak out each time i read or see the reasons behind shunning which are all so silly and have no experience or logic behind them even coming from very experienced meta players)</li></ul><p>NOW look at all that above and i can garantee you that is an effort worth of a daily half time job of 3 hours.</p><p>i would be glad and ready to make a new simple random towns posts to be posted in all random towns in first few days which could make a small diffrence but you would need the persons posting those to have time to invest in those towns, post and run wont help i fear.</p><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_3926538 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="3926538">k0l3</span></span><cite><p>that's why I keep saying that having to build battlements to use watchmen, removing camping, explorables and raising attack with souls basically ruined random towns. I really don't get why you still don't admit it. no one expects random towns to last 15-20 days. but even the crappiest among them used to last 8-10 days, now they barely live to day 5-6.</p><p>the randomly selectec shaman and new soul mechanics may be a somewhat cool innovation for metas or semi-organized towns (such as MMJ or the ones with at least 10 skilled players), but a bullet in the head for all others.</p></cite><p>i agree with you on most of the changes being too harsh on random towns (i am zero expert of small towns and not very <br>enthusiastic about joining them so my opinion on those is useless). <br>i think i was the first to point it out when i discovered the 15% penalty didnt have a CAP. we are on the same page , just on 2 diffrent Lines <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":sq_happy:" class="tid_ico"><br> <br>i did give my opinin about Souls after the mid-season update and suggested this:</p><p><strong><em>reducing the penalty to only 5% per Soul And putting a Cap of 50% even if there are more than 10 Turtured red souls outside. <br></em></strong><br>that alone will garantee that random towns wont die that early as it is now.</p><p>the way the shaman gets sellected is OK And we should accept it exactly like we accepted Ghouls or catapult operator as part of the game so i think that is logicaly easy to accept.</p><p>about Battlements well this part isn´t that much effecting random towns or small towns , as Ruint mentioned my old post above. they should just get wall upgrade v1 and Battlements done before day 3 and that is just good enough since day 1 and 2 can be managed with Tents and DOs and one or 2 guardians or BiA. after all a small challenge in the start of each town is nice because it makes the randoms work a bit more organized and oriented towards one direction to get it done. <br><strong><em>so imo Battlements is OK as it is , if a change is an option by MT , maybe putting Battlements as a CHILD Project of watchtower will be a much better idea</em></strong></p>

                <p>honestly I don't think it's possible to save a town by itself no matter how wise or experienced of the veteran you are. When it comes down to it, it doesn't matter what you do when over half of the town decides to look at the game For 10 minutes and then take off and never come back... The problem doesn't lie with the residence (even the angry knowitalls) it lies with the format and inhospitable environment which is the beginner town...</p>
