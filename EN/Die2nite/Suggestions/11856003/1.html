                <p>Don't hate me just for the title! I recently though of something like that, seeing the Assassin Game thread (<a href="/tid/forum#!view/42277|thread/11766769" target="_self">Die2Nite Assassin Game</a>). I don't have many specific or <em>realistic</em> thoughts about this new profession, but it could be fun thinking about stuff just for fun (because I doubt that anyone would listen, as it always happens with all the other suggestions).</p><p>So, the point of this profession is that it has to enforce CLEVER griefing or SELFISH PLAY. It does not have to enforce running with a lot of objects to die in the desert.</p><p>So, abilities of the Assassin (or Ninja or Thief or whatever):<br>- Important: the icon near its name is the icon of a resident, but everyone in the town will know that there's an assassin in it, as it will appear the number of assassins in the hero list down the citizens table.<br>- He can try to poison an item once per day. 50% of success (he may use another item to rise success? or have it in the rucksack? this will rise suspicions if someone takes the item, etc).<br>- He can poison a player's food once per town. 100% success if the food is in the chest and the player outside. 75% if the player's in town and the food's in the chest and 50% if the food is in the player's rucksack (this percentages may rise using the same object as before).<br>- View someone's rucksack once per day. Steal an item from the rucksack once per town (this ability is combined with the last one, so if you want to poison someone's food first you need to view his rucksack using this ability).<br>- Jump the gate if it's closed.<br>- Ignore 5-10% of zombies attacking you house (maybe you can have objects in rucksack, like having camping items). Minimal zombies ignored: 1. (If you have 10 house defense and 11 zombies attack you, you will survive).<br>- Don't share your CP. You can take advantage of other player's CP, but you can choose not to share yours (so they remain trapped with zombies). <br>- Ignore locks/dogs on houses (if the citizen is outside town).<br>- If someone die by drinking food poisoned by an Assassin, the caused of the death will be "killed by an assassin" or something like that. And the assassin gets a distinction (yes, distinction to empower the killing of the innocent <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">).</p><p>Why something like this could be implemented:<br>- The game is called Die2Nite. Right now, you have just a few options to steal or try to harm other players. <br>- Note that they can't steal from the bank without impunity (maybe the should...). So their stealing abilities would only affect other players playing selfishly.<br>- This is not meta-focused, obviously, but not every hero class should be meta-focused <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>That's all! I think, share your thoughts!</p>

                <p>this implantation would need some technical attention which need to "hide" the hero soul page when you become assassin.</p><p>Idea was good.

If we did that, it was because we chose it. The same way that random citizens choose in some way not to play anymore, or playing selfish, etc. In the end, ranking a random town is about luck, now, you can have bad luck and find griefers or selfish players. With this addition, you would find griefers, selfish players and assassins <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>About the reputation heroes, I can't think of any good solution. Those are meta aspects of the game, after all. Maybe you could choose a new nickname, but I guess that that would be difficult.</p><p>P.S. About the icon of the Assassin, if hiding it presents technical issues, just make the Assassin so it has the resident icon. And now that I think of it, they shouldn't have more defense on their houses either or they would be discovered.</p>
