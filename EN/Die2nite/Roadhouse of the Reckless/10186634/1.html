                The rules are simple. Think of this as a diary where everyone can write down about their town or what they did that day in their town.<br><br> Rules:<br><em>You must have average grammar <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_blink.gif"><br>A title for your town's log<img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_smile.gif"><br>And include your town's day rating<img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_ghoul.gif"></em><br><br>Example, I'll start it <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_blink.gif"><br><br><span class="tid_roleplay"><br><br>            <strong>The Itching Community<br>              Day 4</strong><br><br>What we though would be a expedition involving half of our town to the Derelict Villa, turned into a building day until we upgrade our doggone Watchtower so we can be able to travel one more zone back to town without wasting our energy. We finished the Screaming Saws today, which gave me a tremble down my spine because it reduced our supply of nuts &amp; bolts, but no worry now our attack is I'd say 2 days behind us, that's enough for us right?<br><br>Anyways that hacksaw we found REALLY is helping out, ya know? I just used it to chop a twisted plank in half, what a cut it almost gave me on my finger. Our north is completely overrun by the rotskins because that's basically where all the buildings are.<br><br>We are OK on water resources and our town chef and town scientist arr starting to make us some rare food and drugs these days. Like man, we got bandages and alot of drugs like anabolics, pharma. products, etc. (even some cyanide)<br><br>Now onto the deaths. We had some of us die like Gehennxx, SaintM, and Sir_cachito die of dehydration. I'm sure they died of heat strokes, because the weather outside is quite spicy. Some guy named WSIDorWCID went outside to 'camp' at the Water Processing Plant, and during the attack, 5 minutes in we Hedro spotted him in the mob of  forty-four rotters. Sandi, a girl, died last night we suppose. She was bitten on the arm pretty badly two days ago and we had no drug to help her. She was bleeding out, so we took turns caring for her. When it was my turn this happened:<br><br>I was walking into her house, finding someone that had left her a few minutes ago had given her something to eat. I found her srawled in her bed, taking fast, twitchy bites at the sandwich.<br><br>''Hey Sandi?'' I said. She looked back at me, her eyes bloodshot.<br><br>''Hey,'' She replied, putting the sandwich down. She was pale, very pale when I saw her. Her cheeks were sunken and she was almost bed-ridden. ''I'm.. I'm going out...''<br><br>I chuckled, ''Going out where?'' And then her answer hit my gut so hard, my body fell apart.<br><br>''I'm going to that small house up north,I outta' kill some of them for... f-...or what they did, and I ain't coming back.''<br><br>And that's what she did, she died of generilized infection yesterday at that house. Shedoe, our guardion reported seeing her body in the small house, well what was left of it. The good thing he said, ''was she didn't turn.''<br><br>1-10 <strong>rating</strong><br><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_dig.gif"><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_dig.gif"><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_dig.gif"><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_dig.gif"><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_dig.gif"><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_dig.gif"><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_dig.gif"></span>

We did a expedition today to the Derelict Villa and this Abandoned Bunker several miles out. We got a lot of items, a total of 4 of us went out, one brave fellow named Sigma actually sniped some of those rotters from the Watchtower with a jerrycan gun (filled with toxins) at the infected and they, literally, were vaporized by the acidic liquid.<br><br>Me, Jasmin, and BluE are here now, at the Villa. We helped BluE find a tomb and helped barricade it. We gave him this WEIRD looking vegetable we sprouted from the garden back home. That reminds me, how can we build a garden in the middle OF NOWHERE?!<br><br>Fine by me I guess.<br><br>As the sun comes up, we are communicating with the people from home, including the other scavenger, a buff female names Shedoe who bashed open a ghoul's head with her shield.<img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_ghoul.gif"><br><br> We decided to somewhat 'tap away' at the <em>Big Rebuild</em>, putting some elbowgrease in between days.<br><br> Now, at the Bunker I found a blueprint, a purple one too. Shedoe took it back and looked, well observed, it for a good twenty minutes. Now, we have a thought that the blueprint gave us, since we have a vegetable garden, why not make a fertilizer? And that my friend, is now one of our main priorities.<br><br>Carrying on, we killed a reasonable amount of rotskins, I think a little about fifteen. Speaking about killings, Hayden, a builder, i srecieving complaints by fellow citizens to shun him. Seven people say they didn't like how he used some of the jerrycans to kill some infected. He has refused to do ANY work and I really think, some of us also (Jasmin <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_blink.gif">) thinks we should just let it slide.<img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_chat.gif"><br><br><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_death.gif"><br><br>We had some deaths today. Well, not really death, deaths, but we presume they are. We haven' theard much from a friend of mine Orpheus, he is a fellow veteran I saw eight days ago on the CB radio talking about joining up with some 'coalition members''. He disappeared last night, just like those rotters Sigma took out. And, 2 of are men didn't make it outside either: Dyslex and Just S. We reported them either missing or dead, or even <em>un</em>dead.<br><br>Now, as the sun shine's on the forest of sand, I sit back, on my manbag (its for men too!) and look at Jasmin and BluE chatting in the corner. I chuckle. Later, me and Jasmin'll be going back to town, BluE says he's gonna camp here, find us a idea to build out, physically and mentally. This is goodbye for now.<br><br><br> Draink, signing <em>off</em>.</span>

''Ya' got some sleep there?'' I said, resting my hurling stick on my shoulder.<br><br>''Yeah, well, sort of I guess,'' Blu said, showing off his Brazilian voice. I left him there, scratching the sand off his head saying ''don't get your decker in a pickle Draink! You know no one will fetch it out for ya!''<br><br> Anyways, I met Padelis and Avenger one kilometer up, searching the zones until they were empty-handed. Avenger said they would go to the Bunker in a hour, after they were done handling their dicks.<br><br>When I went into the Bunker, I was listening to this Ipod shuffle Ayase found at the Water Processing Plant off of a janitor. I think that's what got me messed up but whatever.<br><br> I sit here, in my tent with my eye blood-streaked and feeling like someone scraped their fingernail against the tissue.<br><br>The cause: I fell.<br><br> I tied Muncho outside, yeah? And I went in listening to a rock song(it was pretty good too!)and found a construction kit after beating the guts out of a rotter I saw yesterday rummaging through the waste.<br><br> The rotter was a man, about five feet and six inches off the ground. He had a green face, like he had just thrown up or something, with ripped up doctor's clothing, his medical mask tight around his neck. There we several bites around his belly and arm, but I think this bastard killed himself.<br><br>Feeling my lungs cramping up due to the intense air in the room, I tried to turn around, but slipped on a freaking table. A table! Turns out it cracked my skin near the eye, and its killing me!<br><br>Mystical brought me a bandage and warped my eye up to stop the bleeding, I think that'll heal me up.<br><br>Also, may I add that we did have another death two nights ago. David ''<em>Devastator</em> Rizz was found dead in his bed his skin all wrinkled up like a dried-up sponge (may I add he looked yellow from the heat), so we presumed his body die of a heat stroke due to lack of water. We gave him a, well sorta proper burial outside of town walls. And we had another dehydration caused death: ''<em>Poopy</em>'' McRoar, he's buried near Rizz.<br><br>Our plans for today are to build the Mist Spray, Fertilizer, and tap away at the Big Rebuild.<br><br> Also, the community shunned Hayden because of his jerrycan-killing spree incident, but me and some of my friends will help him by getting him the stuff he needs.<br><br>Haul for the Day:<br><br>Battery, Can Opener, Pharma Product, Screwdriver, Water Pistol (Empty), Mouldy Neapolitan, Sheet of Plywood, Twisted lank, and a Chest which contained some type of liquor in Russian words. <br><br><strong>Water Supply (as of this log entry)</strong><br><br>33x Water Rations in <big>Well</big>.<br>13x Water Rations in <strong>Bank</strong> <br><br>Defense (will go up by end of the day)<br>202 defense.<br><br>Attack (as of this log entry)<br>165-185 rotskins<br><br><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_ghoul.gif"></span>

We are currently setting out exterminators/scavengers loose to control zones that border the town. About two hundred-twenty seven to two hundred-sixty six! Jesus.<br><br>We got our buff builders occupying the construction sites, building materials for the Grater, Fertilizer, and the Plywood. We have the community voting up the Workshop, which Hedoro kindly suggested so less <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_ap.gif"> is to be spent working on the barricades and flamethrowers: The Big Rebuild. We have its construction stopped until we get atleast 20% of its work done.<br><br>Speaking of energy, we had four vegetables and two WARTer melon looking things, they were ripe I can tell ya, but they look like a hairy rat you find in a junkyard!<br><br>We also built the Grapeboom, and managed to get three bombs, courtesy of <span class="rpTool"><img src="../../../../gfx/icons/r_surgrp.gif" alt="">&nbsp;<strong>Ayase</strong></span>  who managed to tie the high-pressured semtex onto the red fruit, and to tell you, they had sweat coming from every single speck of their body, but they are one brave bastard! That semtex would of popped any day now.. with all that green crap covering it.<br><br>I scavenged at the Water Processing Plant, help out Ayase who found two jerrycans, a loose chicken, and some other materials. My eye got better, so it helped me find alot!<br><br>Also, the town exiled... ABRSM? Abrasem? Sure let's go with that. He mixed some medicine into a valium shot and a energy drug, and then he shot out towards the Water Processing lant where he's camped twice and and goes there everyday, well not today, he's still in his house, talking with some of his neighbors, he really liked the <em>Star Wars</em> trilogy, no wait, series!<img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_ghoul.gif"><br><br>Today's Haul:<br>Muncho's haul!<br>Chinese Noodles<br>Full Jerrycan<br>Twisted Plank<br>and..<br>Unlabeled Drugs<br><br>My haul:<br>Energizer.. Battery?<br>Squawking Chicken (poked me in the face a good amount of times)<br>A wet Twisted Plank of wood.<br>Unlabeled set of Drugs(opened with two more refills)<br>and..<br>A wrought iron.<br><br>Savings:<br><br>Gomenolium was stuck 4 kilometers from town you see, three rotskins he said were ''marching with sniffing hands'' as they lead a army of undead towards town. I quickly grabbed my Battery Launcher.<br><br> I slide in a cylinder packed with gunpowder, the battery charged, pulsing electricity. I finished consuming my little meal, a bruised vegetable.<br><br>With food in my stomach, I hurriedly set out, communicating through walkie-talkes with Gomenolium. As I went there, I picked up a wrought iron along the way, seeing how heavy it was. Muncho must be pretty tough, I thought.<br><br>Idiotically, I went straight up to the zone, just waving at Gomenolium as he was crouched behind a lump of rock.<br><br>Without thinking, one of the rotters came up from behind me, awkwardly falling on my chest as I shot in the air. The battery exploded near us both, some shards glistening off my cheek, but most of the damage was absorbed by the rotter.<br><br>Throwing off the body, I threw out the shell casing, reloading a new one and then slamming down the hammer on the back.<br><br> I could tell the other two were near, but the sandstorm raging in the area was enough to make my eyes tear up.<br><br>I reached for the collar of my shirt, covering up the layers of skin from my nose to my chin. I brought down my hair, but it was no use. My hair is too short, the kind that looks like it gets grown out and cut ever few weeks.<br><br>The pistol in my hands, I felt unstoppable, but I was no match for what I faced next.<br><br>A freaking clown leaning over a gutted pig.<br><br> The pig was already dead, its organs being fished out by two rotters, a gray-looking female taxpayer wearing a totally wrecked suit, sliced open at the back and sides to show her raw intestines wrapped around her rib cage.<br><br> I was shocked as the clown surprisingly stopped its meal, leaving the taxpayer tearing into the heart of the juicy, pink pig.<br><br>I raised the gun. Shot. And everything was silent.<br><br>I could hear my ears ringing as my legs fell under me, something trying to grab at my face. I knew I hit <em>something</em> but really wasn't sure.<br><br>I struggled, my vision filled with foggy air and sand. Soon, the weight was lifted off my chest, but the pressure remained a still.<br><br>The next thing I noticed was I was back at the town, walking to my tent. And acting like nothing happened. The good thing was, Gomenolium was safe, but the bad.... the clown... he's still out there... I can hear'em.<br><br>Deaths/Missing Persons:<br>Jouishy: Reported missing outside, never seen again.<br><br>If seen:<br><br>Female, white, fair skin, wears red flower on ear. <br><br>God, I hope you're okay....<br><br>Water Rations(as of this log)<br>8x <strong>Well</strong>.<br>5x <em>Bank</em><br><br>Defenses(as of this log): 277<br><br> Fair well, for tomorrow we will see, who really is, the 11 'o clock hero.<br><br><br><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_sites.gif"><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_refine.gif"><br><br><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_sites.gif"><br><br>  </span>

Me, Avenger, Padelis, Phoenix, Ruk, and Gome wiped out a portion of the rotskins near the town, where we are now? At Fraser D's Kebab-ish of course! For several hours we have been searching the ruin. <br><br>Luckily, I found the following:<br>Compact Detonater<br>Flatpacked  Furniture<br>Vegetable<br>Water Ration(from Well)<br><br> My lips are parched, so I'll drink my water as soon as I leave this corner later in the early hourd of morning.<br><br> By the way, might I mention we had a chat with Adzman, a active guy on the CB radio, we heard at his town, the Circles of rebels, the conditions were terrible.<br><br> They had some water, but they had atleast six deaths in town due to the infected getting through. He gave us word that the town is in chaos, every man for themselves. Someone even killed themselves.<br><br>Here at the Itching Community, we killed one hundred at least of the rotters, 'cuz our attack is low than last night.
