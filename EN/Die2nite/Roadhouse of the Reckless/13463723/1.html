                <p>I have to say it doesn't appeal to me personally - the rules are just too specific. And you're excluding classes again. Why not just allow people to play the classes that they want and let the event emerge from that, rather than trying to pin it down so heavily?</p><p>Although everyone will probably go Survivalist anyway.</p><p>The turning point from "in town" to "out of town" is also a bit vague, I think. Why not make it a certain day? Or just have everyone do the camping thing after the day of gathering items, because isn't the town part of it accomplishing nothing but just passing time before the meat of the event?</p><p>I also think you should probably rely on players to adhere to the rules rather than bother Epoq with it. Epoq's willingness to make private towns for us is limited to special occasions, not something to be abused. Also, I don't think there's any coding in the game that would allow for players to die if they try to camp a zone twice.</p>

                <p>to all of you who say this is curtains for you.. how do you get a town working TOGETHER!!! DING DING DING TOGETHER KEY WORD! to a copy of a town where every man is playing selfishly? this is a town set to be like a real zombie invasion where you know you have 1 day before it hits so you have to go out and get as much as you can to survive with the rest where in the end when you figure out your doomed you go to every man for himself and abandon the stronghold.<br>i excluded tamer and shaman for a couple of reasons<br>1- i banned the tamer because yes it might be helpful to get items in on day 1, but once it comes to lockdown and camping it has no use<br>2- i banned the shaman because unless you have deaths on day 1 its useless -except for distinction hunters- <br>3- both classes dont have a good advantage in camping or survival <br>___________________________________________<br>this event has camping and survival for to reasons A: the survival is for fun for anybody who wants to just chill out and have a fun town<br>B: camping was made for anybody who wants to compete to win!<br>__________________________________________<br>this event WAS NOT COPIED FROM OR STOLEN FROM CAMP2NITE OR CURTAINS, i do not know why if i make an event i have to be attacked for copying another event instead of getting some ideas and helpful feedback</p>

                <p>I also disagree with ColdFlame. I don't think that talking about "pillars of the community" makes any sense. When we create events and contests, the idea is not to be a pillar but 1/ to have fun and 2/ to get things going and hopefully inspire others to get creative as well.</p><p>I can totally see Andrewmaniscool start something great one of these days and I am glad to have him around.</p>

                <p>Andrewman, I will say that while I don't agree fully with Coldflame, it does seem to me that you really are very eager to come up with an event for the sake of coming up with an event, and for the sake of continuing the momentum of your gain in reputation. <strong>IF</strong> that is the case - and I admit I could be wrong - then my advice is that you can relax. You're already showing yourself to be a community player, you're already on the road to a salvaged reputation, and I think it's better to really think your events through.</p><p>I don't believe you've copied other events such as It's Curtains For You, but I do think this event has problems. Too many rules is one of them. It's best to keep things as simple as possible. Start from the ground up and just add rules as necessary. For example:</p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">Everybody scavenges on day 1 and spends the night in town. Starting day 2, it's every citizen for themselves. Anything goes, except you're not allowed to return to town, or camp the same spot twice (or two nights in a row - whatever). Whoever survives the longest wins the award.</span></p><p>At its core it's a good idea.</p><br><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_1798488 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1798488">Andrewmaniscool</span></span><cite>to all of you who say this is curtains for you.. how do you get a town working TOGETHER!!! DING DING DING TOGETHER KEY WORD! to a copy of a town where every man is playing selfishly? this is a town set to be like a real zombie invasion where you know you have 1 day before it hits so you have to go out and get as much as you can to survive with the rest where in the end when you figure out your doomed you go to every man for himself and abandon the stronghold.</cite><p>Okay, so thematically the idea is that the town works together under the threat of zombie invasion and then when the attack is overwhelming it's every man for himself. That's dramatic, but I'm not sure it works so well in game terms, and that's why it needs trimming to something simpler. Working together is a fine idea, but what purpose does building a town beyond day 1 serve to the event at large? It just wastes time before the main part of the event, especially if no-one can go outside to scavenge.</p><br><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_1798488 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1798488">Andrewmaniscool</span></span><cite>i excluded tamer and shaman for a couple of reasons<br>1- i banned the tamer because yes it might be helpful to get items in on day 1, but once it comes to lockdown and camping it has no use<br>2- i banned the shaman because unless you have deaths on day 1 its useless -except for distinction hunters- <br>3- both classes dont have a good advantage in camping or survival</cite><p>I understand they're not as useful as the other classes in this case, but does that mean you have to ban them? People will enjoy your event more if they can play what they like without silly restrictions. If they make a decision that doesn't assist them in camping or finding items, then they may not perform as well in the event. That's fine. You don't have to dictate that decision; people are capable of deciding for themselves.</p><p>I wouldn't exclude teams either, if I were you. There can of course be only one winner, but allowing people to work together if they wish makes the event more dynamic. It's up to you, though.</p><p>I think one of the things I'm getting at is that... the event is made by the participants as much as the organiser. Rather than try to dominate the event with rules, why not let it flow naturally as the players decide what they want within the bounds of the core concept?</p>

Justification:<br>A: It was a personal attack. Not going to lie.<br>B: Make <strong>Fun</strong> events all you like. I just find it slightly annoying that your 'events' are always total rehashes of ones which already occurred, such as curtains and camp2nite (Don't deny the similarities).<br>C: You can trash my events all you like, it is your right. And also, Your 'good events' compared to my 'Bad events'. Again, this is another personal attack, deal with it. All the worst events on this forum have come from you. I challenge you to find an event worse than 'who gets lms' anywhere on the forum.<br>D: As you say, those threads are for spam. I am telling to stop trying to run before you can walk.<br>E: Don't deny your clear plaguarism of camp2nite/curtains.</p><p>Face it. You fucked up. acting like some big community leader won't fix that. try taking part in a few events before starting your own.</p>

You're already showing yourself to be a community player, you're already on the road to a salvaged reputation, and I think it's better to really think your events through.</p><p>I don't believe you've copied other events such as It's Curtains For You, but I do think this event has problems. Too many rules is one of them. It's best to keep things as simple as possible. Start from the ground up and just add rules as necessary. For example:</p><p>Everybody scavenges on day 1 and spends the night in town. Starting day 2, it's every citizen for themselves. Anything goes, except you're not allowed to return to town, or camp the same spot twice (or two nights in a row - whatever). Whoever survives the longest wins the award.</p><p>At its core it's a good idea.</p><br><p>Okay, so thematically the idea is that the town works together under the threat of zombie invasion and then when the attack is overwhelming it's every man for himself. That's dramatic, but I'm not sure it works so well in game terms, and that's why it needs trimming to something simpler. Working together is a fine idea, but what purpose does building a town beyond day 1 serve to the event at large? It just wastes time before the main part of the event, especially if no-one can go outside to scavenge.</p><br><p>I understand they're not as useful as the other classes in this case, but does that mean you have to ban them? People will enjoy your event more if they can play what they like without silly restrictions. If they make a decision that doesn't assist them in camping or finding items, then they may not perform as well in the event. That's fine. You don't have to dictate that decision; people are capable of deciding for themselves.</p><p>I wouldn't exclude teams either, if I were you. There can of course be only one winner, but allowing people to work together if they wish makes the event more dynamic. It's up to you, though.</p><p>I think one of the things I'm getting at is that... the event is made by the participants as much as the organiser. Rather than try to dominate the event with rules, why not let it flow naturally as the players decide what they want within the bounds of the core concept?</p></cite><p>ive been mulling over the ideas mentioned here and i understand that building might not be as fun, but with the above mentioned post i may add more towns and i may make the day limit 5 days of scaving -so you can get more supplies and at least than you have a much better chance to survive longer and get LMS if you choose to stay in town i may allow the classes but im unsure if shaman will be allowed since the core of the event renders the shaman useless, now i may allow it if i decide to to make the winners of the town battle on score</p>

Instead of one already set in stone. Feedback will be helpful and you can see how it will be received by the community. I would be happy to play in a well-organized event arranged by you.</p><p>Eeeeeeck Edit! tl;dr? <em>Lets be supportive? </em></p></cite><p>i am actually looking to plan a bigger major event based all around shamans -to give them some glory since they dont have much use- but i do need some help to throw around ideas and such about how it will work then propose an idea, but id like to start planning it after this event takes place, or at least not right away that is<br>but as a spoiler<span class="tid_wspoil">the event will sort of be a mix around every event like camp2nite and curtains put in one but only involving shamans and a few residents willing to die, OR the event might be about having some shaman only towns with 10 residents willing to die right away to see if a shaman town that has red souls does better than a shaman town that uses its souls for score -the winner would be based offfa score- again just an idea but i think itd be fun in the future</span></p>
