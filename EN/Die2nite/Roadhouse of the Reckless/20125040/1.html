                <p>Tell me, how did it all started? Where did Zombies came from? How did most of it turned into wasteland? Heard some rumors? Where you there? I want to hear your theory!</p><p>Here is mine..<br><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Some say the careless scientists where behind it. Scientists? Careless? Never! (not including Gordon Freeman, but he was sabotaged anyway)<br>Here how it happened. On end of the 21st century, people really start like ugly cars. Allmost everyone had few Hummers. Humvees (solely) made air unbreatheable and water undrinkable. That caused gene mutations. People just turned in to zombies (dam you Darwin!). Zombies can breath polluted air and don't need to drink at all. Mr evolution though that braiiiiiins are unneeded part of human physiology, because they did not use it anymore (they trying to get some by instinct from lesser life forms - homo sapiens). That only happened in megametropolys like New-New York. Countryside like London was untouched. Sorry to brake it to you guys but you are all hicks..</span></span></p>

"we" have been around a long time, watching fr diasters and making sure they dont go haywire and we had an operative who had this idea that the governments of the world were plotting to kill everyone. we didnt lsiten. so he went off on his own searching for clues and things that might prove his theory, by the time he found proof it was already to late. we only know what his recordings say up to that last one and most other have been destroyed with weaknesses to how to stop the zombies but we know this:"log 21 date:-unattainble- location-classified- : ive found what seems to be some sort of lab with dead persons in it... it seems there are scienectists bringing them back to life!, WAIT whats that.. i thought my cover was blown... i have to bring this back to base or this will kill everyone -turns around- wait WAITcrshhhhhh....." this tape was recorded right before the first one , he was blugeoned by somebody trying to help him but he was so insane that he killed her thinking it was a sting, and ran while recording the message, in that first message there used to be more telling us where tapes are ones about weakness such as water and effects of drugs and ghoulish behaviour , but the tape has a virus on it that cant be remoed slowly making the tap useless... we can only hope that the illuminati can avert the extinction of humans</span></span></p>
