                So I have been thinking of this for a decent amount of times. And I would like to bring this discussion to you. <br><br>Some of you, may be part of a meta, and as you may know when you are in a meta you tend to have dates set to jump into a town. But what about in between those towns? and what if you die early due to some mistake? <br><br>I know many people, and I am included in this group. That do "derp towns" towns in between meta towns were you jump in, have some fun and get some distinctions. Its all fine and dandy, sometimes we talk a bit but mostly just grab distinctions such as the expert discovery distinction. <br><br>I like doing this, its fun and I will admit I would not have 5 distant discoveries without doing this. I have taken drugs from the town to do this, normally it goes un noticed and everything because I personally have never been shunned for it. <br><br>Doing this has become such a norm for me, I was on the d2n channel one day and asked a fellow player if she would like to come along with me. I thought nothing of it. She is a "newer" player to say the least she is a very kind person and tho new to the game very experienced in town from what I hear. <br><br>But her response to joining this town when I said, <cite>"join a town have some fun and get some distinctions"</cite> was along the lines of<cite>But distinction whoreing hurts towns!</cite><br><br>Doing derp towns in between has become so normal to me I have honestly stopped thinking of this. We all know that random towns have less communication and in a sense, don't do as well. <br>And I have never thought of how much it really could be hurting the player base. <br><br>So i would like to ask you, what is your stance on this sort of thing? How do you feel about "derp towns" in between meta's and their affect on the players/random towns. <br><br>Please just friendly discussion. <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_smile.gif">

                It is pretty discouraging when people in your town kill themselves when you want to survive. I try to keep that in mind whenever I join a town or consider new clan members.

                I always join random towns in between meta towns. But I also always play the first few days as if it was a good town. After those first days you usually know if it's a 'good' or a 'bad' town. If it's a town that will die within a few days, I'm going for a combination of helping/distinctions (so I don't do things that will kill the town, but I also don't play 100% for the town's best). If it's a town with some active players I try to keep the town alive as long as possible.

                Usually, I jump to local towns between meta jumps, it can be a lot of fun teaching basic stuff to newbies as long as there are enough people willing to learn. My last local town lasted 12 days, witch was pretty good considering most were first time players.<br><br>I don't give a damn about distinctions (ok, I do care about Scout distinctions, but that's it), so I never make a "derp jump" or whatever, with that in my mind. Help newbies, make a local town last more than the average and chill, that's what I like to do in ramdon towns.

                I do like to collect distinctions, and if i find myself with a few spare days between towns will jump into a random town with the main purpose of farming a few distinctions , i won't actively hurt the town, but i don't see why i should be forced to play solely for the good if the town either .for me this game would get boring quickly if i couldn't enjoy fun towns as well as serious ones .

                Uber and Workshop were right on the money.  You can (and <strong>should</strong>) to both.  I always do a short hop into a "derp" town when I can.  I'm not a true distinction whore, but I do have a few things I covet.  The trick is to accomplish your goals without doing undo harm to the town.<br><br>My last town lasted 12 days, gave me three launchers, an aqua, 350+ Zed kills, and LMS.  About half of the people in the town claimed it was their longest/best town ever, &amp; that they learned a great deal of strategy.<br><br>Mission(s) accomplished.

                Unfortunately, alot of people within meta towns are heros, and then residents in normal towns see that heros are just derping around, and get the wrong impression. Too many towns I have seen people blaming derpiness on being a "douchebag" hero. <br><br>It seems like if you are a hero and in a meta you are expected to screw up everyones shit when you are not in a serious town, its not a fair judgement but thats what I have seen in the past few random towns I have done, weird, huh?

                I do the derp towns between jumps, but I try to help the town while I'm there.  And the majority of the derp towns I've been in lately, I haven't died on purpose... I've either had a legit camping death, or have stayed until the town dies.  When you're in a small town, they don't normally stay long so that's where I kill time between meta jumps.

                It must be noted that some random towns just don't have any chance from the word go.<br><br>Quite a few newer or less experienced players don't know yet that it's not a good idea to jump late in the day, or right after the attack and they end up in towns of relatively poor composition when it comes to its population. <br>They get all excited just because a few people post standard organisational threads (often filled with old fashioned stereotyped, poor strategies or plain mistakes).<br><br>Don't make me say what I'm not saying - not all random towns are like this but there's definitely a pattern.<br><br>In those towns, you are a saviour or a best buddy if you help a bit or stay alive with them until day 10+.

                You know, jumping into small map towns to derp doesn't mean that you are going to play like a dick. Sometimes you just need a break from an organised town, and this gives you an opportunity to play a more relaxed version of the game.<br><br>Sometimes, new people/players will ask you questions, sometimes they won't. Does it matter? If an experienced person can provide the spark for a new person to learn more about the game and become part of the community, doesn't it benefit us all?<br><br>I have found in about 80-90% of derp/small map towns that you can find 1-3 people really interested in learning more about the game. Welcome them. Help them. Link them to what they need to know. Who knows, you might end up with them in a meta one day...

                I don't like the term "derp" in this context because it make it sound like you're intentionally acting like an idiot without any care for the damage you are causing to the town. Every town is a "serious" town. For newer players, the towns they are in are learning grounds, both of the game and it's community, and seeing people constantly jumping in, Heroes especially, and just messing things up for everyone isn't a good way to introduce a new player to the game.<br><br>In my opinion, the first day in any town should be tread upon carefully. Give the town some time to see how it's inhabitants are going to act. I'm all for not being super serious in a town if it's obvious that town either isn't trying to rank/survive or is already full of enough derps and inactives that it stands no chance of ranking/surviving, but make sure you haven't accidently sniped someone's meta-jump first. =P<br><br>Small maps are good for avoiding accidently sniping someone's ranking attempt, since small maps can't rank, and I go into small maps often with the intent to do a little distinction hunting and otherwise not be serious, but it doesn't mean you can't help out the newer players by offering advice when the opportunity presents itself and by bringing in items needed for constructions and surviving.<br><br>I usually don't go taking control of the building order or trying to tell people what they should/shouldn't build, but when I see someone suggesting a building I know is a bad choice, I usually chime in and give them some constructive insight on what I've learned and observed.<br><br>You don't have to be serious, but my best advice is don't derp. Feel free to keep what you find in the World Beyond, but don't go stealing from the bank or other players just to be an idiot. =P And I wouldn't suggest bringing in decoration items unless you have cyanide (and it's day 5 or later) or the town is already in chaos mode.

                I personally loath the habit.  I think its incredibly disrespectful of anyone who takes the game at all seriously but doesn't do the meta thing.  If you have dead space while waiting for a meta jump, <em>just wait</em>.<br><br>Basically, if you wouldn't do it to a town with your meta in it, what does it say about doing it in other towns?  That only metas matter and everyone else can go to hell.<br><br>I have the same attitude about people who join a town, then suicide out to join their meta.<br><br>Its exactly the sort of behavior that makes so many none meta players start to think metas are a plague on the game; because except within their own little hermetically sealed sphere, they often are.

                I wonder why we can't have these discussions without insulting others?  You don't like meta's we all know thomas but to speak about metas constantly in a bad light says more about yourself than anyone else.  Seems very single minded, exactly what you insist you 'loath'.

                I don't think Thomas insulted others.<br>I didn't see him name names and use insults towards set players.<br>Did I miss something? (Maybe I did?)<br><br>It is his opinion that metas act as a plague - it's his opinion and he's entitled to it? I don't see him trolling the forums about it either and I thought his post was in the right place at the right time?<br><br>I must say I appreciate what thomas is saying and I like the general idea of it. I am not saying I agree with it - I understand that a massive amount of people just want to play with their comfy metas or they'll just sulk and quit, we saw that. So, realistically and to allow everyone to play the way they want, it seems like accepting metas and their consequences is the way to go. <br><br>I think it's actually quite nice of the author of this thread to reflect on the consequence of our play in random towns with regards to the game.<br>It's something that's bugged me for some time, too.<br><br>I am babbling on, I am full of it, but in the end, my opinion for what it's worth is that we're a GREAT community and things seem to work themselves out in the long run because we care and because we can talk about things without insulting others <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_smile.gif"><br><br>I totally should re-read this before submitting it, but it's Sunday night. &lt;3

                There are always gonna be people within random towns who are going to clash in ideals and personalities, everyone in this game has been witness to that. I think it is safe to day if it wasn't a meta player going for distinctions, it is just gonna be someone else! Random towns are just that. Random. Full of different people with different wants and needs from this game. <br><br>People do what they do in towns because it is what makes it fun for them. Difference being meta players wouldn't take the hacksaw day one and run off into the world beyond with it, they would just hoard items to make a battery launcher, or something xD <br><br>But yea, "derping" cannot just be put on meta players hands, some people play like this all the time, as it is what they enjoy about the game, so what if some meta people also enjoy doing it every once in a while, they are 100% within their rights to do so. Also, its all within the rules of the game, and making decisions on how to deal with selfish play or how to work together is also part of that too!

                I don't hate metas.  I was in one for a while.  I hate some of the mindset that seems to go with them.  People who play with metas are, I think, in a sense not playing the game as intended, but MT presumably could fix that if they really wanted to, so it's not my gig to bitch about that.  And people with metas who are doing so because they just like to play with their buddies aren't doing any great harm.  Nor is there much to bitch about regarding people who do the full 40-meta size isolated towns aren't a problem except for people who are feeling competitive about town scores.<br><br>But there's a very visible part of meta culture that considers ordinary towns and players as disposable, and that's loathsome and I'm not about to stop saying so.  <br><br>There's a whole range of behavior this grows from this mildly annoying (a player who dies out in his meta town so he joins another town; he plays fairly straight until his meta is ready to jump, then suicides.  Pulling himself out that way leaves a hole in the town that doesn't need to be there, and has nothing to do with anything but the fact his meta is more important)t ob to the downright obnoxious (some of the distinction hunting people would never do that's mentioned above, that can actively harm the towns its in).<br><br>Not everyone in a meta does these things, so its not "caused" by metas, per se.  But the culture of "your meta towns are what matters" is exactly what breeds these attitudes, and I think it should die in fire.

                And to be abundantly clear, LilMarie has some of the right of this; there are people who are not meta players who distinction hunt, or play selfish regularly, or grief.<br>And I don't think highly of them, either.<br><br>But the bottom line is, no one has much good to say about them as players unless they bring something else to the table.  "Derp towns" on the other hand, are clearly acceptable to some people, because they aren't "serious play".  And that's pretty much a meta thing.<br><br>I can respect someone like R3dd3r as he indicates above.  I still think there are some problematic elements to it as I mentioned above, but at least he's making some effort.

                Well in those random towns I think the real problem is 13+ players that always die in the first 3 days. Sure the meta player that jumps ship after 6 days isn't helping at that point but I would much rather have one of them join up be active at least for the first bit then some player who is going to die outside the first day, or of dehydration a couple days later. <br>Random towns are hard you have alot of players who want to do their own thing and don't play well with others, players who mean well but have no idea what they are doing, distinction hunters (solo players who always play that way and meta players), griefers, new players that do well, ok players, and if your lucky you will have 4-5 competent knowlegeable players to help try and make all of these different mindsets into a cohesive working town. <br>So for me I would very much like to have helpful competent meta players in my random even if they have to jump ship before the town is over as I feel they can do more good in that time then most of the other random citizens.

                R3dd3r, at this point I haven't been playing as long as some of you, but I've been playing long enough that I have to say I think you're exaggerating some of the things you say "random" players do (not in terms of them doing it, but in terms of frequency).  Once you get away from small towns (which are inevitably going to get a lot of early die off since they're the place starter players go to decide if they like the game at all), I don't see huge amounts of early die off in normal far towns in the first few days (that doesn't mean it can't happen but its far from a given).<br><br>Specifically, I can promise that virtually every deliberate suicide I've ever seen (as compared to the occasional "handling cyanide is an invitation to misclick" business) who's said anything about it indicated it was meta related.  I'm sure there some others that are normal coalition related (and most of the criticism I'm directing here goes just as thoroughly at them; I think its just as bad an idea if you're group is 5 or 40), but it doesn't seem to be done as much of a matter of course there.  As far as I can tell, the routine player considers it the thing to do to suicide out of a town as soon as his meta's ready, and that's just the mildest expression of this.<br><br>Basically, if normal towns are just something someone is doing to kill time while waiting for their meta, with the attitude toward other things that go with that, then just sit the damn game out for a little while.  If people are going to go into random towns, go into them like you're actually there to play.

                What about the people that die 7 days  before the end of their meta town... plus the next 3-5 days (at least) that it takes to put the roster back together and communicate when the jump is and blah blah blah).  That's two weeks of boredom within the game and two weeks of hero unlock progression that gets lost for those that are working toward unlocks.<br><br>Just as you accuse r3d of exaggerating the frequency of random folks griefing/distinction hunting/etc, don't you think you may be exaggerating the "derpiness" of meta players?<br><br>More often than not, a meta player is going to jump into a small town if they're only looking to be a distinction whore and continue the unlocks.  Hell, other than expert expeditions, it's easier to farm distinctions in small towns <strong>while helping the town.</strong>  Yep, that's right.  I said it.  Not all distinction farming is harmful.<br><br>Look, the fact of the matter is that most random players (especially in small towns) don't know what they're doing.  They run outside, grab 2 items, then come back in spent for the day.  Or they run out and get stuck by zombies and cry for help... repeatedly.  Or they just never log back in and die outside on the first night or dehydrate on the third.  Let's say, for just a second, that the meta player is building any launchers or aquasplashes or chainsaws they find... what's the problem here? They just gave a really nice weapon to the town.  Or going out and searching the ruin every day.  Bringing back a full ruck to put into the bank? Oh no, not that... ANYTHING but that!  Taking a drug to go further and explore more of the map? Well... isn't that kinda the point of having the drugs in the first place?<br><br>Yes, sometimes a meta player will suicide out to join their crew.  But I'd say that the vast majority of meta players that do that will join a small town because a) they know it's coming, b) it's not ranked so they're really not hurting anything, c) they likely won't even be missed.  If the person has had enough time to there be helpful enough to be missed, well hell, then the town has already received more help than they would have if the meta player had just sat out, right?

                Thomas I looked at your soul and your 10 best towns, and I counted up everyone that died in the first 3 days of your BEST towns and I got 120 deaths. That means on average there are 12 deaths in the first 3 days of your randoms towns. That means that over 1/4 of the population is dead in the first 3 days. I would say that is a pretty serious problem and more detrimental to a towns success then pretty much anything else.

                @thomas , so you're saying i can only join a town if i have the same goal for that town as you, that i don't have the right to play in a town as i want to. i don't have a singular meta as such but i do play in a lot of organised towns, in an organised town i join on the understanding that i am there primarily for the purpose of surviving as long as possible. i join other towns where that is not my primary purpose. That's not to say my purpose for joining a random town is never to survive as ling as possible, sometimes it is, but my enjoyment of this game comes from playing with different goals for different towns

                I guess i see where the problem is. thomas seems to want to settle a fairness issue here that i dont see.<br>furthermore ill try to explain why:<br><br>1. This is a game after all people play it for the fun.<br>2. Even in very competitive towns RL always comes first.<br>3. Some, but not all gain most fun in this game by plaing this game competively.<br><br>you should go from here yourself if don't want to this illustration might help you:<br>see d2n as any other team game lets say Fußball(football,soccer)<br><br>most people play it for the fun in their free time. they just go to a place where they can play it(any town) and find people to play with. They might have to leave after half an hour for an appointment or because they're exhausted and dont enkoy playing with the folks they encountered and played with. Of course you can go to the field with your friends too and are likely to ahve more <br>fun.<br>You can play selfish, aggressive stupid and it all will be dealt with as the peer sees it fit.<br><br>But you can also play competively in club (meta) the club wont let you come late for a game you signed up for or even a training. a player wont leave training without serious reason and even more they wont just leave with no reason if they're just in a game against a competing club.<br>They will play by a fixed set of rules and there are defined punishments for not  complying with them. club football players can still enkoy a fun game on the field with random players anytime, as can a fun time player always decide to try to get into a club. <br>now thomas do you consider that wrong or unfair? because what i see here is pretty much how it is in d2n.<br><br>Cause you're arguing that club players dont play fun games with randoms as seriously as their club games and hence fun games would suck. and neither in my example nor in d2n i do believe thats true.<br><br>So please help me see your point.

                I've bit my tongue while reading this discussion with interest....but I'm taken aback by the fact that no one else has brought up this tactic;<br>I'm not a Meta player but I do focus on Theme Towns and I've jumped into random towns and posted in the Welcome Thread that I plan to be dead on Day N of the town.  I also mention that my lack of a fear of death can be used as a strategic advantage to the town.  I've never had a single complaint about it after that and some of the better new players even come up w/ suicide missions for me that help further the town.  <br>Lemons in to lemon-aide.

                Thomas said <cite>Its exactly the sort of behavior that makes so many none meta players start to think metas are a plague on the game; because except within their own little hermetically sealed sphere, they often are. </cite><br>which I found insulting.  I don't play the game this way at all and to say that meta players do that is an insult.  RFMs did the clash, we did the MMJ, a lot of other meta players did the clash and MMJ.  I help the community, I share my guide that I wrote to help myself initially blah blah.  <br><br>I don't agree with R3D that going into a small town give para and only taking water (in fact, we do much much more than that) then suiciding isn't hurting the town.  It absolutely is and I've accepted it.  Fact is, I'm not all about helping each town succeed.  Who is?  I'm not a fracking saint, no one is.  I do try to do this only in small towns though, with one exception this season.<br><br>kiwi says<cite> @thomas , so you're saying i can only join a town if i have the same goal for that town as you, that i don't have the right to play in a town as i want to. </cite><br>This is exactly as I see it.  It's as narrow minded as he and others say meta thinking is.  Though, Thomas did clarify and I find his subsequent comments just fine, not insulting.  Other than meta playing should die in a fire.  I wonder how other players would feel *I* felt their style of play was loathsome.<br><br>But, that's moot because you say 'meta culture' breeds the attitude that random towns are disposable.  This is incorrect, a great deal of players don't take the game seriously and view every town as disposable and they are not in a meta.  It's the nature of something you are doing as a pass time - a game. <br><br>You say MT didn't intend this game to played the meta way and I agree.  What I don't agree with is that you think *your* way is the intended way.  The intended way was people who don't know each other surviving, trying to get along and survive while the vast majority either don't care about their survival or actively making sure they survive or gain personally above everyone else.  <br><br>In this way, the game is flawed because we are *not* people who don't know each other any longer we are a small community and people will band together.  You think after a year + in a zombie apocalypse people won't have formed communities?  That's just what we did here.  So, the 'intended' way is doomed and game is evolving.<br><br>Madwilly states it quite well.  The difference between organized sports and die2nite though is that the community is incredibly small.  So, people playing not so seriously are often actually competing with others who do.  And, it might seem unfair, sure.  But, I don't see fairness as an issue.

                <cite>Basically, if normal towns are just something someone is doing to kill time while waiting for their meta, with the attitude toward other things that go with that, then just sit the damn game out for a little while. If people are going to go into random towns, go into them like you're actually there to play.</cite>Who says they aren't going into the random towns to play?<br><br>Sure, they aren't going into those towns to play the same game they would with their meta, but they're still playing the game all the same.<br><br>Most random towns I go in I go into to camp until I die, something I don't do with my meta since in most meta towns we're trying to optimize and live as long as possible. In a good, organized town, that means 15-25 days (depending on where RNG falls when the breaches and camping failures kick in) where most random towns are pretty dead by day 8-12 (if not sooner).<br><br>Does it matter that I'm screwing around and burning through my good camping days, especially when I'm camping different buildings to get the blueprints, blueprints the town might not even muster the resources to actually build? Does it matter that I'm burning through my good camping days early in a town that is highly unlikely to have a chance of ranking (or is a small map that cannot rank at all)?<br><br>No, it doesn't matter, nor does it matter much if I suicide out after 5 or so days when the prime resource digging and camping days are over. By that time most random towns have so many deaths that it's more a chore to try and survive, sitting around bored and losing expensive hero days to do nothing. Even for Residents it's a boring time to sit in town for no real gain beyond a few soul points, so really is no biggie if the whole town mass suicides after a week to 10 days.<br><br>Yes, if the town is active and scavenging and most of it's population is still alive after three days (the first mass dehydration day), and defenses are on the rise as well as resources coming into the bank, with less than 10 people doing extremely stupid things, then yeah, I'll adjust and sleep inside more often and help with building and resource gathering. But even the most active of random towns are circling the drain by the 10th day, no matter how well you think they're doing before then.<br><br>What does erk me is when someone jumps into a town with intentions to suicide that very day because they know their meta is jumping the very next day. What purpose does it serve anyone to jump in and suicide same day? No distinctions will ever be kept, so how are you helping? Especially when you go out to zone ludicrous/stupid where anything you dig up most likely can't be retrieved? At that point, it's better to stay out of town for that one day.

                Annette, I'm sorry you took offense, but I can't do anything about that.  I've pretty much stated my piece; I think certain behaviors are obnoxious.  If someone wants to embrace that and take it as a personal affront, that's up to them.  Its not directed at anyone specific in this thread, because to the best of my knowledge, the only ones I've played with in this thread are Joker (who I had no problem with) and Workshop (who I had some with, but has always at least seemed to understand my issues).  <br><br>To respond to one point someone said, if you get killed off in a mid-period (I believe seven days early was the quote), hit up a small town; those probably won't last much longer than that in most cases anyway.  But if its a choice of sitting out two or three days or playing three days and then suiciding, yeah, I think the right thing to do is sit it out.  If someone is offended by that, that's their problem.<br><br>(Oh, and as to the person who was counting my towns: note what I said was in regard to normal far towns; both the small towns I was in this season and the hardcore ones are going to have a different dynamic by their nature in terms of early loses).

                There needs to be "derp" towns for the people that want to distinction whore. Otherwise anyone who joins a town knowing they won't give it their all is lessening the experience of the other 39 people playing.<br><br>For those that say it's ok because they help noobs, I think you're trying to delude yourselves to lessen a guilty conscious. You might help them learn a thing or two (probably not), but you're certainly not helping them learn how to survive long-term.<br><br>I did my first distant region town a couple days ago. I was super excited after having "done my time" in the noob towns and because there were like 24 heroes in town. I thought it was going to be an amazing experience. Ya, 15 people died in the first two nights, and a fair number of them were heroes.

When people have different goals (usually a random town), you can't trust the people you are with will save you if you need it, and resources placed in the bank are just as likely to be used for the survival of the town as they are just to gain a distinction (or be wasted by someone who doesn't know any better (read: a newer player)).<br><br>So yes, when people play with their meta, they're going to <strong>help their community</strong>, and when in a random town they're more likely to <strong>live (and die) alone.</strong><br><br>Sure, some of us may offer our advice, maybe even add a few resources to the bank for them to try and learn how to use effectively, but when the survival of the town is already compromised, trying to maximize survival (read: survive 25+ days) isn't one of our goals.

                I think the only thing that matters is if you enjoy what your doing. I dont pay for hero time to help in small towns or to make sure every town lasts x amount of days. I buy hero days to enjoy myself and for the benefits that you can't get while being a resident. If i join a random town and i like the look and vibe of the people and forums i'll stay and work with them since i enjoy it. If i join a town where people never read the forums and do as they please i'll just do my own thing until i get bored of it. <br><br>Even if i join a town that is doing well but bores me i would have no qualms in dying to have fun somewhere else. People dictating how people should play the game or what is acceptable or unacceptable behaviour "disgust" me.<br><br>So until somebody else pays for my hero days, or the rules change to force you to not derp I'll do my own thing. Frankly, i don't give a damn

                No, actually, Annette I can't stop people feeling insulted when I critize some aspects of meta culture; they need to start distinguish between the culture they're part of, and them.  I'm certainly not going to stop saying something is bad because someone wants to claim it as their own; if they want to be insulted by that, be insulted.<br><br>My purpose isn't to be insulting, but I'm not going to be quiet just so someone can feel good about something I don't think they <em>should</em> feel good about.<br><br>This thread was about certain sorts of behavior; I don't think the original poster would have started it if all he wanted to hear was "its all cool."

                How you communicate masters, Thomas.  If really want to have a conversation insulting language won't achieve it.  Your judgement of his others play, when you could just state your points without judgement, makes me not even want to have a conversation with you and for sure not listen to you.

                I've been keeping up with this thread, but maybe I'm forgetting some things in the large chunks of time between new posts coming in, to the point this thread is now a case of "too long; not re-reading"<br><br>But if memory does serve me right, in the case of <em>thomas vs metas</em>, the meta folks are defending themselves against their style of play being "bad"; however, in the case of <em>derping vs not derping</em>, I do believe many of those people who are pro-meta are still largely (but not completely) anti-derping.<br><br>Re-reading the very first post again, the best response I can give is: Games are meant to be fun for the player; if you aren't having fun, then it probably isn't the game for you.<br><br>Know your town. I don't believe you should derp day 1. You should go out and scavenge 8 or 9 AP out and come back to town at day's end (going out 8 AP is best if you opened the gates or intend to close them, or if you intend to build your tent up day 1 for any reason). By the time day 2 comes rolling around you should know what kind of town you are in and how much derping you can get away with (if any).<br><br>If you find you have accidently randomly jumped into someone's planned meta jump, you might earn some saving grace if you work with them and follow their rules until the major breaches start (usually 14 days). Even if you're intending to distinction hunt, I can tell you working with my meta earns me a lot of distinctions, and usually faster than I can earn them in any random derp town.<br><br>Otherwise, by day's end, you can go through everyone's personal registry (by visiting their house) and checking what recorded activities they've performed that day (and what items they're hoarding in their chests); this might give you a good insight on how organized the town's going to be. Checking forum activity (who's talking and what they're saying) could also be a good indicator.<br><br>If you don't mind being shunned/hung on sight because you know your meta-mates know you're a good player and asset in your private towns, the by all means, go full-on derp day one.<br><br>Otherwise, this game is designed to be a <em>survival game.</em> Neither is it designed to be a team survival game nor is it designed to be a solo survival game, rather it's designed to be a community survival game. From the community of 40 in your specific town to the community of a LOT more from the entire player base, wherever you go you have to deal with people with different goals.<br><br>Yes, it is a proven fact that organized towns working together are going to survive longer, but nowhere in the rules does it state you have to work together or survive as long as possible (but your community might have unkind feelings against you if you don't).<br><br>But when the shit hits the fan, the game not only supports but encourages taking matters into your own hands to ensure your own survival (just remember that your community might have unkind feelings against you when they find out you're holding out on them; after all, they might want to survive, too).<br><br>The game even supports taking a suicidal approach to the apocalypse, offering you several ways to off yourself by days end, providing cyanide and poison (yes, you <em>can</em> poison a water ration and then drink it yourself), stand out in the world beyond and wait to die, double-dose on drugs and wait for the addiction to kill you, wound yourself and wait for the infection to set in and kill you, and a number of other ways. It even offers ways for the rest of your community to off your suicidal butt (or stack the odds in their own favor).<br><br>So in this way, yes, the game does support derping and distinction hunting. The only question you need to ask yourself is to what degree do you want to piss off the community? Whether you go into the town with the best of intentions or the worst of intentions, it isn't what you do but how you do it that is going to determine whether or not your behavior is acceptable to that community (read: town).

                The problem with that Annette, is that I <em>do</em> think this is a bad thing.  If other people don't think so, that's their gig, but I don't see any reason to suggest "its just another way to play" when I think its a rude and disrespectful way to play.  Like I said, its not intended as an insult to any specific person (f I think some individual is being a jerk, I'll just tell them, not bounce it off a wall), but if people want to be insulted because they cling to what as far as I'm concerned is a bad behavior, well, I'm just not going to get too concerned.<br><br>I still think there's a difference between insulting a person and criticizing a behavior.  People can change their behavior.  People can mitigate their behavior (R3dd3r pretty much presents an example of this way upthread).  The fact that some people can't separate it off is unfortunate, but its not a good enough reason for me to act like behavior I think is bad is acceptable.

                That's a fair cop, Ghost.  However, as I said, I don't think they're completely unrelated (there are those who disagree, obviously: again (his posts must stick in my mind) my exchange with R3dd3r farther up), as every person I've ever seen talk about "derp towns" and act in that specific way (treating some towns out the gate as ones they were just going to screw around in) was a meta player.  I can't help but think that's because they see towns they're playing in with their meta as "serious" towns and others as "casual".  <br><br>Its this tendency to treat non-meta players as pretty much second class that is the root of most of the problems I have with metas,a nd I think this is just another piece of it.  That not all meta players act in this fashion goes without saying, but the fact its fairly common among them isn't prone to making me think its a completely disconnected phenomenon.<br><br>But you're quite correct there's nothing stopping a non-meta player from treating some towns as "serious" and others as "derp towns", and if I've implied its <em>purely</em> a meta issue, I've failed in my point.

                <cite>I can't help but think that's because they see towns they're playing in with their meta as "serious" towns and others as "casual".</cite>I am inclined to agree with you here. The MMJ was my first real run with any kind of a "meta" (even if it was more a random assortment of people with the common goal of surviving as long as possible). Then there was my own meta as it was trying to form, and onward more to the Clash of the Titans.<br><br>I think the view between "serious" and "casual" (or "derp") towns comes from the idea that if you aren't organizing 40 people to survive as long as possible, then putting in that much time and effort on building plans and finding the most optimal way to survive for as long as possible (read 25+ days) only to have some random derp come by and screw it up with distinction hunting, or forgetting to log in and come back to town, or doing just plain stupid things because he either doesn't know better or just doesn't care.

                Well, I'm going to be the last to tell you that random towns can't have some serious losers in them, so I can understand their frustration here.  That's why I'm willing to say the R3dd3r's and the like are fine; any downside they're producing is balanced by the benefit they bring to a random town.  <br><br>Its the "screw around for two days then jump with my meta" folks that make my teeth ache, because in practice they're worse than a middle of the road player (the ones I typically see) who hang out, do some scavenging, do some building, and probably die out late in the cycle.  And they've effectively displaced such a player (remembering my premise is this is the rank and file typical random player) by being there.  They effectively <em>become</em> the sort of player that they presumably like to avoid in those towns.  <br><br>At that point the only thing worse is deliberate griefers.

                So thomas, Do you not think players should be allowed to just join a town goof around and then go with their meta? <br><br>players do have the right to play the way they want? provided its not actively griefing. ( the kind that is against the rules, or even just opening/closes gates stealing hacksaw and running 15km out ect ect)

                I think players should be allowed to do whatever they want.

Before I was a part of a metacoalition, it was a pain in the ass to have to play with noobs and assholes that died early.

Was it rough? Make it out okay? Are you a big boy or girl now? Cool. Great. Terrific. Sarcasm! I hate to boil it down to such condescending terms, but I think it really is this simple: <em>two wrongs don't make a right</em>.<br><br><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_refine.gif"><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_refine.gif"><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_refine.gif"><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_refine.gif"><br><br>We are the community, and we have the power to change the game for the better or for the worse.

                Umm sorry but why is it up to the 'senior members' to set an example for others to follow? <br><br>Why do people who have been around for a long time have to sign up to some job where they must play the way some people find acceptable? These people don't owe anyone anything.. They are here to have fun and enjoy the game in whatever way they deem fit as long as it doesn't break MT's rules. They aren't 'perfect' little robots who never want to rebel or experience different things.<br><br>All the things you mentioned that are huge to new players, Sense, can still be achieved whether or not a meta member suicides. The town can still build things, survive a night, work together etc. One of the best parts about this game is dealing with what you have been given. Playing the card you have been dealt. That may be dealing with a griefer, a new player, someone who suicides, a nazi leader... If nobody challenged 'social norms' and everyone fit into a neat box, this game could become pretty stale.<br><br>I hope a lot of people realise you don't HAVE to help a town survive if you don't want to. You also don't have to hurt it either. Nobody has the right to 'expect' others in random towns to behave a certain way, they didn't sign up for your rules when they joined. <br><br>Suck it up people, it is part of the game. Get used to it.

Half the people that left this game with the meta cap left as much because MT decided that our usual level of play was unacceptable as the fact that they couldn't play with their whole group of friends.<br><br>Why does a meta member have a responsibility to a random town that a random player doesn't?  Is it ok for a non-meta person to suicide because this town obviously isn't what they wanted to deal with?  Is it ok for someone with 300 soul points to do? 1000?  Why the double standard just because someone might be a "known" name in the game?<br><br>I don't know about you, but I play games to have fun and to forget about the demands of real life for a while.  Sometimes I have fun in serious towns aiming for the leaderboard.  Sometimes I have fun being (or trying to be) an anonymous resident in a small town that goes ruins exploring every day.  Sometimes I have fun with a group of friends in a distant town being completely silly and doing whatever strikes my fancy.<br><br>If you don't want to play with me, that's  your prerogative.  But you don't get to tell me how I'm expected to play - as long as I'm playing within the rules of the game.

                Thomas, I don't really care what you think of how I play.  This isn't about whether or not what I or you do is right or wrong Thomas.  It's about constant bitching I see about others in the game.  Dude, you aren't changing anyone and people with a high sense of their own morality, like you and Sense, looking down your noses as the rest of us is a little sad.  <br><br>Play a different game if people playing a game within the rules makes you so arghghg.  Seriously, you might feel better in the long run.

                Well I was only referencing the points that Thomas had already made, centralizing on that blurb. I thought I made that clear in my original post.<br><br>Edict is the wrong word. You and everyone else can do whatever you want, that's fine. I use the word "should" to declare what I think is right and wrong. I understand that this behavior isn't griefing, and certainly isn't against the rules, but I also understand why people do it. I believe that those same needs could be fulfilled without hampering the experiences of others -- IF we as a community come up with something. I know we're capable. <br><br>Motion-Twins decision to cap metaplay was a failed attempt to solve the problem of player conversion from beginner to dedicated member. It was fundamentally flawed in that it severely hurt the value the game offered to dedicated players. Just because they had the wrong solution doesn't mean the problem they identified was invalid. <br><br>I'm not talking about players in metacoalitions, famous players, leaderboard or distinguished players. I'm talking about any player with the <em>awareness </em>of the problem. The only reason I mention the senior members is that they set precedents that, like it or not, the community follows. And I'm not attacking anyone that kills themselves, only those who kill themselves for "metagaming" reasons, in other words, reasons that extend beyond the realm of the town. Suicide because someone doesn't want to deal with a town is fine. Considering the town as the game, the wikipedia definition of metagaming I am referencing is "the use of out-of-game information or resources to affect one's in-game decisions."<br><br>I don't want to control you or anyone else. I am just campaigning because I think it's better for all of us if we play more respectfully of others. There aren't rules about it, and I love that. But the game could be better and more fun, and it's up to us. I think as experience quality goes up, more new players will stay with the game, and it funnels all the way to the top competitive and social aspects of Die2Nite. <br><br>I would love to play with you, and I'm sure tons of players would too. But if you're going to kill yourself midtown, I will just be discouraged. <br><br>Annette, I know it seems like I am claiming to be innocent, but I'm not, and many metacoalition are the same. Recently I drank a poisoned water to jump into a new town. Sometimes players are dragged into towns but don't want to dishonor their previous agreement or miss out on a town so they take a walk. <br><br>We can make the game better, for everyone. Isn't that something we can agree on? It's better we come up with an idea before MT screws us over with another game-ruining regulation. Epoq said the MMJ was influential in the decision to lift the cap. That's proof enough!

                Hey, since its reached the point where I can't post anything that's critical in any way of the meta culture on here without some members on here get bent out of shape about it--go ahead.  Get bent out of shape.  I'm tired of actually trying to clarify to make you happy, and if you want to decide I'm the Evil Meta Ragger-On, go for it.<br><br>But I'm pretty much with Sense.  I don't think there should be anything "forbidden" on here, except for some forms of griefing that the mechanics of the game make essentially impossible to deal with, but that doesn't mean there aren't forms of play I think are massive jerk moves and should be discouraged.  You're not required to agree, but I'm also not required to shut up about it.

                You know what the problem is? It isn't because you are quote "critical in any way of the meta culture on here," it's that you completely lack the guts to stand by any of your positions. As soon as someone engages you on any point, you immediately start portraying yourself as the innocent victim of all of this misguided hate and vitriol. The only time you take a solid stance is when others post a similar opinion whereby you can deflect some of the attention back on them.<br><br>It's shameless baiting and demonstrates both cowardice and a thorough lack of any ability to take responsibility for your own ideas. And it's the main reason that I and many others cannot tolerate any of your responses on any topic you choose to take part in.<br><br>It's always someone else's fault, isn't it?

                No, you can't stand me because I don't kiss up.  I've made my positions pretty clear on what I do and don't think is a good idea.  But if I stick to them people bitch about my harping on things, and if I try to meet people halfway, I "lack courage".  So far as I can tell, its damned if I do, damned if I don't.<br><br>So let's make it real clear: there are people on this game who do things I think are jerk moves.  Some of them are in metas.  Some of it, I think the meta culture enables.  Got all that?  That clear enough for you?<br><br>Now, part two.  That doesn't mean all of them are jerks.  Some of them just don't think about it, some don't see the harm they're doing, some think its just all part of the game.  <br><br>I just happen to think, in many cases <em>they're wrong.</em>  And I don't see reason to stop saying so because people don't like it, or how I present it.  Because to be real damn honest, I don't think it would matter how I presented it; they just don't like to hear it, period.  <br><br>The only reason I mention other people sharing my views (at least in part) in these threads is that sometimes I think they express it more clearly than I do.  <br><br>But like I said, if I'm honest I'm "insulting", if I try to meet people halfway I'm "cowardly" if I try to make my own points I'm grandstanding and if I reference someone else's I'm "deflecting".  So the hell with it.  I'm going to say what I want and people can just deal.

                You say were are 'jerks' and we are supposed to take it well?  Actually, we did take it well.  Why would you play a game where that supports jerks?  MT took the cap out, you have to think that this version of the game supports metas. <br><br>Do you tell other people of other communities you frequent, maybe your job or school, that they are jerks?  And, if you do, they have nothing to say about it?  <br><br>The community is already what Sense described in his last post.  I don't see meta players going into towns and ruining them at all.  I do see the damage, mainly on large maps, but it's not worth getting my panties in a bunch over because it's part of the game.<br><br>I wasn't going to go here, because it's not about me but a couple coalitions from my meta go into small maps and find the ruin, map it and post the map for all to see and use.  We answer questions, make an irc room if people want to hang out and ask questions or coordinate there in addition to the forum.  This is what I see metas mates doing.   I have no idea what we all do but this is what some of us do.  I don't care what the others do.  Life's too short to point fingers and pass judgment.

                I didn't say anyone was a jerk.  I said they did "jerk moves".<br><br>Criticizing behavior and criticizing people are different things.  They really, truly are.  And yes, I criticize behavior in all sorts of context.  Because you know what?<br><br><em>People can change their behavior</em>.<br><br><em>People's behavior in one area doesn't say anything about their behavior in other areas.<br></em><br><br>So one of two things is going on:<br><br>1. They're trying to convince other people that this sort of behavior is OK, that there's no harm in it, and that its not selfish and rude;<br> <br>or<br><br>2. They're trying to convince themselves its not.<br><br>In neither case do I think that should be let pass, because I suspect strongly the acceptance of this sort of thing is exactly why there's so much of it.<br><br>But if I thought people were simply irredeemable jerks I wouldn't even bother.  In fact, I expect that if a lot of people on here weren't enabled in this sort of thing by a lot of other people telling them it was okay, there wouldn't be a fraction of it going on.

                And to make it clear, again, since people apparently have ignored it the last several times I've said this I<em>'m not pointing at all metas or all meta players here.</em><br><br>What I've said, and I have all evidence this is true (even from within this thread) is the culture of treating meta towns as different from random towns breeds this sort of "its okay to screw around in random towns because they don't matter" mindset.  Certainly a good majority of the suicides in towns I've ever seen were meta related, and any defense of it has always been on the "my meta is more important" gig.

                What in the hell made you think I was ever referring to dehydrators as "suicides"?  I'm talking about people who clearly and deliberately choose to die out of a town, not everyone who did it because they lost track of time, had finals or (especially in the case of small towns) just decided the game didn't interest them.

                Dehydration Deaths through lack of logging in are just as bad as suicides, if not worse, in my book. It goes back to the argument YOU came up with saying "If you're not going to play the town to it's fullest, then don't play it", so you, sir, have successfully contradicted yourself. Good Day.

                As far as that goes, people <em>should</em> think about whether they're going to have time to actually do what they need to before bothering to join a town.  But I'm quite willing (especially from the comments that often get appended when someone screws this up) to believe that's usually more not thinking it through than knowing the consequence and not giving a damn.

Because that's BAD in someone's opinion.<br><br>Look, whether you like it or not, meta gamers are not the griefers you're painting them to be.

I don't know when you joined this game, but I was one of the many that got to flounder through... sure there was a wiki, but there was no one in a random town to help steer the town and give advice and ask questions of.  So obviously, the game has gone totally backwards now that a lot of newbies get that option for the first few days of a town (and often much longer than that).<br><br>I... totally... see your point.

                And I'm sorry about that, Annette.  Though I suspect people won't believe me, I genuinely am.  I'll even admit I probably used some overly strong language early on because this just frustrates the hell out of me.<br><br>But I really don't know a way to say I can say I think something is bad behavior without people who don't think it is taking offense.  And I don't see how any conversation can go on while dancing around that elephant in the room. <br><br>But I genuinely did not come into this wishing to insult you or anyone.  I just don't see any way to discuss the topic here that people won't seem to take insult from.

                Spacekadt, did you miss the post where I mentioned that R3dd3r's approach (which is what you're more or less discussing) seems reasonable to me?  That he brings to the town as much as he takes away?<br><br>This is why I sometimes think this is pointless; people hear the part of what I'm saying that they want to disagree with, and ignore any qualifications or areas where I've agreed with them.  But like I said, I'm big into tilting at windmills.

                the problem of insults is a totally different discussion, lets try getting the discussion maybe back to the essence of to derp or not to derp, maybe that offensed-discussion can be done in twin-messaging (what a nice tool, thanks MT!)<br><br>Another thing meta players should try to do between serious towns, is maybe be more open to the players in their 'derp'town. It s always better to be honest imho.

                Geez, i remember the early days (Season 1) when meta players were like gods, b/c they knew everything! Nowadays, what does it matter if they mess around, <em>if</em> they don't hurt the town or help it. I've joined a few towns just to mess around while my coa bros are otherwise occupied. It would be cool if they didn't just mess around, but thats the way they wanna play. Its better than being griefers at least, and i don't get what your malfunction is. Like the game says, you can work together or play alone.

                Not necessarily, Kiwuke (hope I didn't mangle that).  Note the target I aimed at initially: person goes into a town to screw around and get achievements (many of which are counterproductive to the rest of the town) and bails out to play with his meta.  That's an extreme case, but its the careless attitude I'm aiming at.

                <cite>Spacekadt, did you miss the post where I mentioned that R3dd3r's approach (which is what you're more or less discussing) seems reasonable to me? That he brings to the town as much as he takes away?</cite><br><br>No I didn't.  But you seem to have missed all of the posts in the thread where the people that want to play their way DO help the town while they're there.<br><br>Instead, you continue to call us jerks and say that we're ruining the game.<br><br>But at this point we're going in circles, aren't we?

                I'm pretty sure I did that in some of my early posts, Spacekadt.  Didn't seem to help.<br><br>Joker, as I said the problem is that there's selfishness the game has some tools to address, and this sort of metagame selfishness, that the only tools to address with are social.  If someone is taking all the DOs and keeping them, you can shun them.  If someone plays hit and run on your town you can do--what?  Make a note about it in your town entry?  That might help with players who mostly played in randoms, because the next time someone would see it coming but for people who mostly play with metas, if their meta doesn't care it has just about no impact.  The only way to break that sort of habit is when people, especially people who the person plans to play with regularly, decide its not cool.

                Well, it'd help if people would look at the targets I've actually described and not try to over-broaden it.  While I'm not going to claim I'm in love with anyone who goes into a town knowing they're going to suicide out (someone earlier said "so we're supposed to sit around bored?"  Everyone has been busy telling me how not-important this game is, yet its so central you can't just sit it out a few days?), there's a big difference in degree in playing for six days and doing your best the whole time, and playing two days while doing nothing but distinction hunting (which seems more like what the original thread topic was aimed at--"derp" after all).

                Spacekadt, you're being way more defensive than you need to be here. It's only distracting from the discussion (somewhere deep down in these posts). The goal of the topic is to discuss choices and understand them, not to discuss the players who themselves make these choices. <br><br>Thomas, don't hate the player, hate the game. I know you aren't intending to make personal attacks, but somehow your posts are having the same effect. The systems in place right now encourage the behavior that you and I think hurts the experience for new players. As we've established, the default choice for players is to engage in what we don't like, and only active awareness empowers players to choose between selfishness and community focus.<br><br>You think there's only one way to go about solving this, but I think you're wrong. If we want to change playstyle, I see two options: Campaign to condemn selfish behavior, and change the game itself. I think by this point we can tell that the first option isn't going to work. Especially considering the massive failure this thread is. All you've done is accrue enemies. Almost nobody has come out of the woodwork to agree with us, and without their verbalized consent, we have no way of knowing if supporters even exist. <br><br>The second method, changing the game, is what I believe this has come to. Think about community events and 3rd party apps. People say all the time that the forum is the game. Well the people are the forum, thus we are the game. There are more ways to cause change than managing public opinion.

                We could either enhance the learning curve for new players so that they don't have to subject themselves to townquits or we could come up with a way to satisfy the demands of players who want to join derp towns without having to include or affect new players.<br><br>An app could act as a deeper tutorial than "rookie mode" that extends beyond gameplay itself and integrates new players into the community. This would empower them to find metacoalitions easily or at least 40 man towns (even MMJs).<br><br>For the derpers, all I can think of is finding a way to organize it to get 40 herping derps together at once so that there's no misunderstanding of whats going on. And if a random person finds themselves in a derptown by accident with 35 others, I think they'd have a blast. It's just when there's a low concentration of derpers that it hurts.

                The only problem I see with Sense's idea is that it requires people to actually choose to use it (the "all derp" towns part).  I'm not at all convinced that people who don't care about what that does to people in random towns are going to bother.

                <cite>For the derpers, all I can think of is finding a way to organize it to get 40 herping derps together at once so that there's no misunderstanding of whats going on. And if a random person finds themselves in a derptown by accident with 35 others, I think they'd have a blast. It's just when there's a low concentration of derpers that it hurts.</cite><br><br>if all the meta players leave the random towns MT wanted us to be in then we are only going to get the cap put back in place.<br><br>towns like scout town were great for more hard core derping where as I tend to "play selfish" but keep the town in mind when I "derp/selfish play" not to say towns wouldn't have been better without me but as an inside to most of my towns that are like this ir is day 3 in sorry pits and we have 12 dead, none of it caused by my derping, 4 died last night and 8 the first night. this is typical, we have had a call for help thread each day where the player has been ignored by the town in favour of them just doing what they want. so 2 people called for help for 20 hours and where ignored.  yes if i was in town i could go rescue them but thats a role any other player could have also done and they are not seen as derpers because they never played a meta town in there life. <br><br>the standard of metas have to act like the perfect example of how to play while others can do what they want is dumb.<br><br>Im all for the community getting stronger and i think it will even with people playing selfishly.

It's a phrase we all use differently.<br><br>To some people, a "derp town" is simply one that they don't have to raffle everything off in and don't have the meta pressures to hit that #1 spot.<br><br>To some people, a "derp town" is a town to join with friends and have fun.  Be a silly class and go exploring.  Be silly on the forums.  And you know what... if you get stuck, it's not the end of the world.  <br><br>To some people, a "derp town" is synonymous with a completely selfish style of play.  Although I'd say this is an extremely small minority.<br><br>It's fine to hate that people die off early because they want to join their friends or their meta.  It's fine to hate that people play selfishly.<br><br>But I'm kinda sick of the generalization that most meta players are selfish pricks if they aren't in meta towns and it'd be nice to acknowledge there's more to the game than the way each of us individually wants to play.  We have choices here.  God forbid we exercise some of them.

                <cite>The 40 player towns I suggested were to exclude the derpers. Derp towns I think should have a minimum of like 15 derping players or something.</cite><br>We already have them, they are called random towns <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_lol.gif"><br><br>I totally agree with spacekadt, watch out about what kind of derps we are talking about. Some (a very few) players see derp-towns as completely selfish towns where they will even kill the town they are in for their own good. Most of the (meta) players see a derp-town as a town where e.g. they will build a devastator they find or where they go for a distant discovery without actually hurting the town a lot.<br><br>Don't forget that most meta-players got in a meta because they were playing a good game for the town. The real selfish players will have a hard time proving they can play good in a meta-town and thus will not easily be invited into metas.

                then perhaps you should stop assuming what people mean and ask for clarification before labeling everyone "jerks"?<br><br>some people are jerks if you go by your guidelines.  and some people are reasonable and good players that are looking for something lower key than a meta run for the leaderboards.

Some players are indeed bad for a town, but most of the (meta/hero)-players in random towns are just having fun and trying to keep the town alive.

I said something like that in my first post in this thread. ^.^<br><br>I've called at least a few of them "relaxation towns" on my soul page this season, as a way of pointing out some towns that were random (i.e. not an organized jump of some sort, like MMJ, meta, or an event) and otherwise weren't played with survival and the leader board as a primary goal. Usually I'm camping and hunting a few other assorted distinctions in these towns. But, as I, personally, don't like having day 0 and day 1 deaths, I usually still try to help the town survive until at least day 5; after that, distinctions count same day, so don't matter to me when I (or anyone else) dies after that.

                I'm afraid that I don't buy the premise that playing "casually" will routinely be as good as the average player of random towns; as I've said before, when it makes people willing to build stupid things for achievements and bail out early, its more like the low (though not bottom) end, and those are the people I've been directing this at from my first post in this thread.

                Not going to change the target to what you want, guy.  I'm directing this, again, at the people who build things only for the ability to put it on their sheet, and then leave as soon as they're wanted in a "serious" town.  And its not usually wonders because that requires sticking around long enough to get some blueprints in.  Yes, they're not any worse than someone who screws around maximally, but that's setting the bar awfully low.

Some people have just been dicks. It is time to ignore all the rhetoric and bullshit. Yes, I am Buddha <br><br>After all 14 pages of back and forth, there has been only 1 point that stands out – that people will play this game as they choose. <br><br>Some of us only jump into small map towns, where, by the time you die only 3-4 people are left, and better that they get LMS so as to experience hero-mode, and you get to help people that are actually bothered to learn the game.

You are discounting the mentoring side of things completely, which is more than likely why MT introduced the Meta-cap in the first place. Should you be someone that takes every town deathly seriously, great for you, but to sit in self-righteous judgement of the many others that don’t is just plain wrong. Bottom line is that there are more heroes and metas this season than last, so it is difficult to prove that players jumping into “casual” towns actually harm the game, or if they provide the impetus for new players to learn more. <br><br>I would think that the greater numbers of paying players / competitive metas /  people posting in the forums would prove that the bar isn’t being set too low. After that, it seems to be down to personalities / wants…

                I'm not discounting the mentoring side of things, Spartie.  In fact, I've given a nod to that several times.  But from observation, plenty of the people who jump in,  screw around for a few days before their meta is ready don't bother with that either.<br><br>As to the rest--am I making a value judgement on certain kinds of play?  Of course I am.  So is anyone who criticizes <em>anything </em>in the game, including anything in the game.  If people weren't making value judgments, no one would care about griefers (after all, they're just having fun the way they see fit, too) and there'd be little point in this sort of thread in the first place.

                Nonsense.  I've said that certain elements of meta culture (specifically the tendency to consider meta towns "serious" and random towns "not") encourage it.  That doesn't mean, as I've mentioned any number of times, that every meta player behaves this way, or does it without mitigating actions.  <br><br>What I have suggested, and nothing anyone has said tells me I'm wrong in this, is that this sort of behavior is considered pretty much okay by the apparent majority of meta players whether they do it or not themselves.  Given the number of people in this very thread who've said exactly that I don't think this is an unreasonable conclusion for me to have come to.

                To give validity to the point of leader-removal being important, I shall provide more psychological boringness.<br><br><em>Group development theory</em> explores how a group comes into existence, how members act individually, and how the group as a whole acts. Specifically, the Tuckman stages of development theory applies very readily to Die2Nite. It claims the following stages apply...<br><br>Forming – Storming – Norming – Performing<br><br><strong>Forming</strong> - <em>The individual's behavior is driven by a desire to be accepted by the others, and avoid controversy or conflict.</em> <big>In Die2Nite, we make the welcome thread and everyone is happy.</big><br><br><strong>Storming</strong> - <em>The team addresses issues such as what problems they are really supposed to solve and what leadership model they will accept.</em>  <big>We argue and fight over ideas to see who's da boss.</big><br><br><strong>Norming</strong> - <em>The team manages to have one goal and come to a mutual plan for the team at this stage.</em> <big>Someone wins and (most) everyone agrees</big><br><br><strong>Performing</strong> - <em>The team members are now competent, autonomous and able to handle the decision-making process without supervision.</em> <big>A metacoalition of familiar players works well together.</big><br><br>When an awesome player comes into a town, teaches and leads, the forming and storming phases are completed very quickly. The group moves into norming and peforming and the town does well with their inspirational leader. <strong>DERP!</strong> Leader is ready to join another town, so he kills him or herself!<br><br>Now the team doesn't know what to do. Who is in charge? Who will step up with an idea? Chances are, it won't be clear cut. "Who died and made you king?" I was asked once (the answer was Tobias). The team is back in the storming phase, and doesn't perform well. The only difference is that now the horde is attacking in larger and larger numbers. Days 1-5 are easy, and there's plenty of room to argue of who's in charge. But to send a town into organizational chaos on day 7 can be very traumatic!

                Then again, most of these players are happy to have survived so long. And death happens regardless of the reason. Having had a chance to think over this thread after discussing directly with you guys, I think I've come to the conclusion that this isn't a very important issue. I still think most all the points in this thread are valid, as Spartie judiciously declares, but I don't think enough people actually care. It was a fun topic, despite a few miscommunications and frustrations.

                I don't typically post in controversial threads. <br><br>I would just like to emphasize to the non-heros, and heros that don't typically post, we don't see you as expendable. Or stepping stones for our own personal gain. <br>The majority of us like playing in random towns with new people and you are what make the game fun.<br><br>I have suicided out of a few towns, But I am typically one of the people that stay behind and see the aftermath of heroes jumping for metas or other organized jumps. <br><br>Most of the time people are excited to play in a town with well-known players. <br>And hurt, yes hurt, that they suicide with minimal contact. And are cavalier about it.<br><br>Just be polite and courteous to the town. It would be nice if you post a brief comment about what you are doing. People respect that more than anything else. <br><br>They jump with the expectation that "40 people will be striving for one goal, the town survival"<br><br>We do have an overall bad reputation. Like it or not. <br><br>We can fix that, somewhat, by being consistently respectful<br><br>I have played with most of you and you are all great and typically conscientiousness players. <br><br>(Also,participating in the COTT, taught me a valuable lesson about the large number of players, ones that never post on here, that actually read what we write....)
