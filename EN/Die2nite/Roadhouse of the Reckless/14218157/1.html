                <p>It's 2 a.m. here and I can't sleep, so forgive my grumpiness, it's not intended (unless you are a certain company, then it is).<br>This might get rather long, so feel free to ignore it.</p><p>I just want to say how disappointed I am in this game and in this company. I had very high hopes that we might get a good game with an awesome community here, in contrast to most other browser games.<br>We do have a great community, a very active and dedicated community that keeps the game alive and fun for those involved. But that's no thanks to MT, who did their best to prevent us from joining up and playing metas etc... <br>Right now, the active, organized community is in large parts disjointed from the random original game. <br>We sit in our ivory towers and play to win. True. But you know what? Randoms suck pretty much. 10 dead in the first 2 days is very common in 100+ towns. After 5 seasons, MT still hasn't figured out a way to teach new players how to survive, or, god beware, how to keep them playing. Honestly, that's embarassing. No wonder people are trying to organize themselves and forget about that random horror.</p><p>You have the best community I've seen in any game so far and yet, you continously show us only disrespect and never ever listen. It would be so easy to support the community, but all I've ever seen is disruptive to communal playing. External forums are not allowed, non-paying players can't use the forums, the forums themselves are pretty bad... No talk of anything non-D2N related... That list could go on. And this is nothing recent or unheard of, it has been mentioned time after time with no response whatsoever.<br>This game lives by its community. <br>Yet everything you do is like a giant "f*** you" in our direction.<br>Don't like the forums? Oh, we'll change them. No, we're not making them better. Instead, you can't moderate threads anymore. Oh, you also need ten thousand clicks more to access anything. We also hid them, you'll never be bothered by new players again.<br>Then, communication. If there is any, it's either through Twinoid or better yet, through facebook or twitter. If it concerns the game, put it in the game where we look.<br>It would also be nice to have someone to talk to for once! I don't mean Epoq replying very rarely, but to have a chat with deepknight or someone in charge, or at least know that someone is actually reading the prizing discussions or suggestions we have. Because evidently, nobody ever does.<br>That makes me sad, because they are good discussions. There are awesome suggestions out there.<br>But why? People are paying anyway. Now they have to pay more than ever. <br><br>Yes, there were good changes. I like explorable ruins, Shaman needs tweaking but is fun and the game flow is as it always was. But that doesn't change the fundamental problems, because those aren't in the gameplay. They are in the way we as a community, paying or not, get treated.<br>The problems are that there are too few new players even trying, because random towns have become extremly depressing.<br>I'm sure things could improve a whole lot there, a decently implemented chat would help new players so much.<br>Any tutorial teaching you the basics, a mentoring program...<br>Instead we get forced Twinoid, crappy forums and a price increase. <br><br>I paid for this game because I wanted to support the devs, I wanted the promised original content, I wanted a good game.<br>I don't think I got much for the money, because what makes this game great for me does not come from the people making this game but rather from those playing it.</p>

                <p>I agree pretty much 100% with you.</p><p>Motion twin is not a big company, in my personal opinion they should stop trying to expand and fix the problems that they have.</p><p>In the time I have played Die2nite they have expanded to have, A spanish server, A german server, Integrate all there games to twinoid. make and produce galaxy 55, Add Minitroopers english server and begin productions on a game called mush.</p><p>All of these were made over a span of 13-15 months. ( give or take, I started playing in season 1 around the end. )</p><p>In the time they made these games they also had to maintain there current games which include Snake, KadoKado, alphbounce, Monster Motel, DinoRPG, MYbrute, fever, Minitroopers French server, Die2nite, hordes ( d2n french server ) kingdoms, and Kube. ( all the ones that I know of at least )</p><p>Now for a huge company that probably wouldn't be a problem, most of those games are small little time wasters that you only need a small team to really keep fun. But Motion twin only has a staff of about 17 people.</p><p>So that is 18 games for 17 people. ( And I have no real clue what games are available in what languages, could be even more forums they have to maintain.</p><p>In my opinion its to much for them to handle. They have some people being overworked, and they can't pay enough attention there current games.</p><p>What do i honestly think the best solution is? I don't want to see this game be absorbed into a bigger company that turns it into something stupid of course. But I also don't want to see it die out due to lack of new content ( deepnight is gone, original content may be a little lacking ) and no communication from the developers.</p><p>Its been 5 seasons now, the time to wait a few seasons and see if the game/Communication between MT improves or not is gone. This is how the game and company are going to be. <br>I am not sure but selling out rights, tho drastic could be an option.</p>

It certainly would be productive and perhaps Epoq / MT would listen to some of the dot points.</cite><p>1) For example: when something goes wrong and the game stops working or when people can't login due to some reason, post a news item or put a message on the homepage saying something like 'We detected some problems and will try to fix them as soon as we can'. this message should be posted as soon as they are aware of any (major) issue. And not let the community guess on the fact if they know about the problem.</p><p>2) Less important then the first one: It would be nice if there is a really really good suggestion (lot's of positive feedback from the users) AND the developers like it, then the suggestion could get marked as 'might get implemented'. (meaning it will be implemented, but they don't need to specify when it will be implemented).</p><p>I don't expect the developers to read all the forums, but maybe 1 (or more) moderators could pick popular (or interesting) suggestions and send a summery of the best (and/or popular) idea's to the developers. The developers could give feedback to the moderators and they could post the feedback in the forum. <br>Again: I don't expect the developers (or mods) to read every single post on the forums. But it would be nice to get some actual developer feedback on some of the suggestions.</p>
