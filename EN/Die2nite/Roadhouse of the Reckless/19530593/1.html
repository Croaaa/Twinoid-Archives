                <p><strong>Prologue</strong></p><p>It has been a long time since you last had contact with survivors of The Event. You remember the old times, seasons ago, where you would band together with the other survivors and fight for your life against the undead hordes, led by a legend of his time, known only as <span class="tid_user tid_user_1438184 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1438184">Sense</span>. 40 men and women would unite under his banner and try to do the impossible. They would try to survive.</p><p>But times changed. People changed. And you were forced, for reasons unknown, to leave your coalition of friends, family almost, and try to survive on your own. It has been almost a year since you left, and now you return, ready to once again unite with 39 other citizens in this personal hell. You begin your search for a new home.</p><p>You trace back to your origins, checking nearby the old towns you helped to defend, but a sad sight to behold, many of your original band of <span class="tid_strike">mishaps</span> heroes were nowhere to be seen. In time, you found yourself at the ruins of <em>The Hellraising Dregs</em>, where you first made contact with your old leader and vowed yourself to him and his cause. You had managed to escape the clutches of the town, and camped far enough away to escape, but your friends were not so lucky. You sob lightly as you collapse before the memorial erected to honour those who had fallen with the town. There were a few who hadn’t, but you doubted you’d ever see them again. You take a moment to remember everyone who is gone.</p><p>Out of the corner of your eye, you see a ragged envelope fluttering in the breeze, pinned to the ground by a small, yet apparently quite heavy stone. You figure it’s probably one of these mystifying and perplexing texts you keep finding scattered around the wasteland, and it’s probably of little use to you, but you feel compelled to read it nonetheless, and head over to pick it up. You open the envelope, which appears to be very recently sealed. It is from <span class="tid_user tid_user_1824156 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1824156">Packersfan</span>, you call him PF because you like abbreviating names. You remember, a long time ago, speaking regularly with PF, and he was a very reasonable sort of guy who provided a lot of help. It turns out he has a group of survivors that he intends to lead to salvation himself, and he has left a number of coordinates on the slip of paper. You look around. There is clearly no sign of life now, or in the nearby future, in this town. You hastily decide to chase PF and his wasteland marauders.</p><p>Hold that thought! What are you thinking?! You can’t simply run off without any supplies. Everyone knows that you can’t walk more than 10km in this wasteland without suffering some degree of dehydration. You check the well for any remaining water. Well that was a waste of time, this town has been abandoned for over a year. You think you spot a corpse at the bottom of the well. You don’t really want to think about that. You wander over to the old warehouse that the town used as a bank. You find a lot of things in the bank, but none of them appear to be useful. There are a couple of sealed packets of food, which you decide to take for the future, and a backpack with some batteries and Kwik-Fix repair kit in it, which you also decide to take, having remembered how useful they were in this now decrepit town. There is a water ration, but you suspect that it may be poisoned, so you leave it behind. You can always use your Survival Guide to find some water later. You have no idea how this thing works, it just does. Without further ado, you begin your journey, eager to catch up to the survivors.</p><p><strong>End of Prologue</strong></p>

                <p><em><strong>Day 1</strong></em><br> <br> You have arrived at your destination, wherever that is. You've been following the coordinates marked on the paper for quite some time now, and you can spot the last coordinate location, what looks like a small town, in the distance. You can already see a number of people milling around the town, organising things ready for the inevitable attack later on that day. Luckily, the night had just passed, so you’ll be able to make full use of the day, and for some reason the town is untouched. That being said, it isn't yet bustling with life, so you suspect the zombies haven’t yet detected its presence. You look past the town and notice what appears to be more people heading in its general direction, and as such, deduce that you will probably have more than a few hungry visitors scraping at the doors tonight. You shake your head at the mere thought of those misshapen horrors, and begin the last part of your journey to the town, taking to reading your <strong>Survival Guide</strong> to pass the time. You feel a sudden flush of energy and… ouch! You trip over and land face first on the ground. Angrily, you swing round to give a stern talk to whichever inanimate object dared get in your way (after spending a year wandering the deserts alone, what little sanity you had left was quickly depleted, and you often find yourself talking to such inanimate objects). But of course, you should have remembered the feeling of that energy by now, as you look down at the Water Ration you just tripped over. Damn Survival Guide, you still have no idea how it works. Maybe it’s faulty or something, it seems to only work when it wants to. You put the Ration in the backpack you retrieved earlier and set off once more.</p><p>You arrive at the town in no time, eager to meet new people. You are intercepted by <strong>PF</strong>, who apparently has recognised you and been awaiting your arrival. You bring him up to speed with your reasons for being here, and what you have done during your journeys, and he explains to you that him and his coalition have just arrived here themselves, and are making preparations for the first night. He also takes the time to explain his strategy for scavenging potentially helpful items, and you offer to be a part of it. After all, before you left, scavenging was all you did. Well, okay, sometimes you liked to make a scene, <em>but you were usually scavenging at the same time!</em> You quickly scamper inside to drop off some of the food that you brought with you at the town bank, along with the Batteries and the Kwik-Fix. You take one ration of food for your little adventure, and you reach to take the Water Ra- or you don’t, because it’s gone. You probably dropped it on the way here, logic dictates, but you were never well known for your logic! You come to the conclusion that the Survival Guide is trying to play games with you, but you will not fall for its wily ways! You collect a water ration from the well, and head off in a westerly direction.</p><p>On your travels, you come across an area (let’s call it a zone, zone sounds much better) with 3 zombies in it. You think you could muster the strength required to uppercut a couple and kill them, but it’s best to save that kind of strength, you never know when it will be needed. Long ago, your tormented existence on this dusty plane prepared you with a really <strong>Healthy Body</strong>, and you are tougher than a <strong>Brick Sh*thouse</strong>, it would take at least a pack of 5 zombies for them to become aggressive to you. This is mind, you continue your meandering adventure in search of those useful items. You keep finding Iron and Wood, and you figure those things could be useful in expanding the town, but you have a good feeling about the zone you just walked into. You begin your hunt for whatever treasure you sense here.<br> <br> Unfortunately, it would appear that your treasure sense is broken. You find some more building materials, along with a few pieces of food and some drugs, which you can only assume are Steroids. Other than that, there’s nothing really all that interesting. You’re walking back to town when you notice the ruins of a Home Depot, and decide to alter your path to accommodate for some exploration in light of your almost worthless scavenging. Upon arrival, you take note that there are a few dead zombies nearby, and all manner of items piled just outside. You’ll come back to those shortly, for now it’s time to have a little explore inside. You walk into the dark, dusty and pretty much empty building, and have a look at what you can find. The only thing of any use is a Repair Kit, which you carry outside and dump with the rest of the treasures in this zone. You rummage through the items left there. Wow, someone really couldn't carry much of this awesome loot. Lucky for you, you’re a <strong>Hero</strong> (whatever that means), so you can carry lots of items! You pick up the Electronic Component and Whiskey, and think about what else to take. But then something shiny catches your eye. It’s a Revolver. No bullets, of course, they were a luxury in this wasteland, and you hadn't actually met anyone who’d managed to find any yet. You weigh up taking something beneficial to the town, like some building materials, but your magpie sense takes over, and you store the Revolver in your pack. What? It will look lovely on your bedside table. You notice that it’s getting dark, which is a bad sign around here. You head off back to town.</p><p>Along the way, you meet a friendly resident who goes by the name of <span class="tid_user tid_user_2063330 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="2063330">LeJabbit</span>, who claims he’s simply too worn out from his travels to make it back to town now. You frown at him and scoop him off the floor, helping him back to town. Hey, you’re getting back into the swing of this Hero thing pretty quickly! Upon your arrival at town, you notice a couple of new buildings. There appears to be a Workshop set up where you can drop all of your poor-quality items off to be converted into decent construction materials. There is also a Watchtower, which you are pointed to and asked to take a guess at how many zombies you think are on the horizon. You scale the ladder and take a good look. You see around 60 zombies, by your thoughts. You've seen them in their thousands, this few will not give you cause for concern. You go back down the ladder and settle in at your allotted bed. You’re going to have to get yourself a tent sometime soon, this is far too open for your liking. As you settle in to sleep, all you can think about is how thirsty your little expedition to the Home Depot has made you. You shouldn't have drank that Ration so soon.</p>
