                I decided to hang out in beginners towns. The first and real reason may or may not have been to finally get an LMS award, I am no martyr <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_wink.gif"><br><br>While I was at it I decided it would be just as well if I could encourage and guide new players to enjoy Die2Nite. The World Forums have been so quiet lately and those who don't really like this new version of the game have been leaving. I still like the game just as much and I'd be more than happy for others to learn to love it and get involved.<br><br>So yeah, I've been posting the following on town forums and also sending it with MrWriter:<br><br><strong><big>_________________</big></strong><br><br><br>Hope you're enjoying playing Die2Nite!<br><br>It's a great game where we need to scavenge out in the desert, build wicked constructions, camp on buildings for nice blueprints and cope with 39 other survivors with various degrees of deceit, lies, kindness or co-operation <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_smile.gif"><br><br>I warmly recommend you take a look at the nice player made applications, they're accessible from the top left corner of your screen, look for the <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_sites.gif">.<br><br>In particular, <a href="http://annetteannette.net/die2nite/almanac/" target="_blank">Annette's zombie almanac</a> has got some nifty information about dehydration and about the "map applications". Very useful! <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_lol.gif"><br><br>Finally, don't be afraid to look at and use the Town Forum and the World Forums. Communication is the key!<br><br>Have a nice town,<br><br><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_refine.gif"><br><br><strong><big>_________________</big></strong><br><br>Feel free to copy and paste it for your own small map towns.<br>Also, if you've got ideas on how to improve it (or rewrite it) please by all means do share!

                Here is what I usually post in my beginner towns.  I've got a few others saved that I sometimes bring out depending on the experience level of the other players, including help on water rationing, scavenging, camping, and ZKing.<br><br><span class="tid_roleplay"><br>Welcome to the town!  I know that die2nite can be a little overwhelming at first, so here is a quick list of helpful information to think about on your first day!<br><br><strong>Forums!</strong><br><br>- If you're reading this, it means that you are already on the right track!  Check the forums everyday to see what is needed, and participate in the discussion.  The town forums are where you and the 39 other citizens in town will plan your defensive strategies for the town.  Be a part of the conversation!  Don't be afraid to ask questions!<br><br><strong>Scavenge!</strong><br><br>- Especially in the early days.  Scavenging for resources in the world beyond will never be as easy as it is today!  Just head out into the world beyond, pick a zone, and start autosearching!  Just remember to make it back before you end up on the wrong end of the food chain.<br><br><strong>Ration!</strong><br><br>- You don't need to drink water every single day to survive!  It's enough to just drink every other day, ESPECIALLY if you are inside building.  Many towns have been brought down not by hordes of zombies at the gates, but from excessive water consumption.  The general rule (there are exceptions) is that you should only be drinking on days when you have the thirsty status (displayed in your status bar up top.)<br><br><strong>External Maps!</strong><br><br>- There are currently a number of options for detailed maps.  These maps allow citizens to keep track of zombies, items, replenished zones, and more.  MUCH more information than can be found on the ingame map.  There are currently 4 external maps, Atlas, External Map, From Dusk til Dawn, and the Oval Office.  Firefox users, you can update all 4 maps at once by downloading this add-on: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox /addon/die2nite-agent/<br><br>Unfortunately there is currently no equivalent for other browsers.  If you're not using firefox, you'll need to update each individually, or find another way of working with your town.<br><br>These applications, and others, can be accessed by clicking the little book icon at the top left of the die2nite screen.<br><br><strong>Don't Panic!</strong><br><br>- If you are in trouble in the world beyond, stay calm!  Post a call for help in the town forums.  If you're trapped by zombies, or out of AP, you can request help.  Maybe a passing resident can lend you enough control points, or take out enough zombies to get you home!  Fleeing from zombies is a LAST RESORT, as it will ALWAYS leave you injured!  Which leads to other nasty things...<br><br><strong>Have fun!</strong><br><br>- And don't take things too seriously <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_smile.gif"><br></span><br><br>I'm trying to hit a balance between letting new players know what they should do to have a good experience, while avoiding the urge to just tell them what to do.  I think this intro manages to fit that quite well.

                @Workshop, great thread!<br><br>@Tirius, great stuff! I like your wording, length and advice.<br><br>Here is what I typically put up depending on the town vibe.<br><br><cite>Hey all, not sure what everyone's experience levels are but just want to have a thread for everyone to share advice/tips/experience/funny moments/epic fails/epic achievements, blah blah blah...<br><br>Here is my advice:<br><br><strong>You have a voice, use it!</strong> Always post on the forums just so the rest of the town knows that you care and are paying attention. If you see problems or want to pitch an idea don't hesitate. This is a group effort and all opinions and suggestions are welcomed. (that doesn't mean we won't make fun of you but that is part of the fun too and helps build a thicker skin which is needed in this game )<br><br><strong>Have a way to communicate live.</strong> Chatzy is the easiest and what I typically use but there are IRC's and other options available. This can really help a town bond and can help get things coordinated.<br><br><strong>Plan or join an expedition.</strong> Exploring the map is in my opinion one of the most fun aspects of the game. Expeditions are also necessary in order to travel safely and discover new buildings and items especially in far areas.<br><br><strong>Problem Solve/Troubleshoot.</strong> Take a good look at the constructions available, the estimation of the attack, the water left in the well, do the "Soul Scroll" to monitor suspicious behavior. There are always options for the town and the more people looking out for it the better. If you have an issue or suspicion of another player it is best to first approach them with a private message but if there is no resolution or response then by all means bring it to the boards for the town to help decide how it should be handled. If you have suggestions on how to plan for the days defense and what to build then make sure to voice them on the forum and support your case.<br><br><strong>Take advantage of the External Applications. </strong>All of them are helpful and unique in their own way. Oval Office lets you view the progress of other towns and see the players in the other towns. It also has a messaging system which is great to keep in touch with other players. From Dusk til Dawn will probably be the front runner for the most used map so try to use and update that map. There are also extensions for chrome and firefox that allows you to update all 4 maps at one time easily. Reading the World Forums is also a great place to learn tips and tricks as well. die2nite.net is also great to learn stuff and not just heroes post there but the entire community has access to it with less restrictions and they have a fun IRC there as well. And of course the die2nite wiki is priceless and can let you know all about the items and buildings.<br><br>That is my main advice. I'm by no means an expert at this game but all of the above have served me well and I enjoy constantly learning more things with each town I join.<br><br>I know this is tldr but I am looking forward to hearing the advice or experiences from other players who are interested in joining in on the conversation.<br><br>Let's have a great run!</cite><br><br>And sometimes I'll throw this in for kicks!<br><br><span class="tid_roleplay"><strong>Ode to a Random Town</strong> (put some twang into it)<br><br>First Day in a Random Town<br>Who will be the 1st prick to let me down....? <br><br>You’re in for a Shocker <br>When you wind up in the Meat Locker<br><br>There’s a Big Rubber D***<br>Or valium, or cigarettes take your pick<br><br>Need to find a Jarpen Table before the day is done<br>Do we have bullets yet for the damn hand gun?<br><br>If you die you’ll end up in a plot<br>Inactives and Griefers!

                The following text is brought to you by, <big>Banshee85</big> Who sadly can not post on the forums anymore. <br><br><strong><big>TL;DR Version:</big></strong> <br><br>Go out as far as you can! Always! Plan ahead!<br><br>If there is a zone more than 9 AP out, take those drugs or alcohol! Don't feel bad--you have a good reason!<br><br>Drop non-essentials on the ground when you stop to autosearch for a while! <br><br>Don't take risks without backup! Stop and be patient! You will survive!<br><br>USE AN EXTERNAL MAP! Look at the upper lefthand <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_sites.gif"> icon. Pick one of these: Atlas, External Map, Dusk2Dawn, Oval Office. Update every zone!<br><br><strong><br><big>Non TL;DR Version:</big></strong><br><br><strong>1) <em>Always scavenge as far out as you can!</em></strong><br><br>The best zones are the ones that have been replenished by the Search Tower multiple times, after several days. Even without the Search Tower, zones will still replenish, you just won't know the exact direction. Choose a target area, and always take what you need to get there for AP. Know your limits--don't go on side-missions if it will leave you short of AP! If you can rescue someone, but will need a Heroic Rescue for instance, coordinate it ahead of time! After you get it set up, trust your fellow citizen to follow through.<br><br><strong>2) <em>Don't be afraid to use the town's resources if you think the return will be great enough!</em></strong><br><br>Is there a zone more than 9 AP away that you know is undepleted? Feel like you need to ask the town's permission to take those Steroids or that Vodka in the bank? Well--take a look at the forums! If there isn't a reason to leave them there, go right ahead and take those drugs to scavenge. That's what they're there for, and why people put them in the Bank in the first place! Use them wisely.<br><br><strong>3) <em>Always drop all of your non-essentials on the ground when you stop to autosearch for multiple cycles (i.e. overnight)!</em></strong><br><br>Why? Because there might be someone in a different timezone who could use any of the items you're carrying--not just what you dig up that you can't hold onto. Drop everything that you don't need to get home! Someone might log on right after you go to bed, get stuck nearby, and the person who could rescue them might have just be lacking the one item you're holding on to! Better to be safe than sorry.<br><br><strong>4) <em>Be patient!</em></strong><br><br>If you get stuck, post a call for help on the forums. Don't simply flee, or fight hand to hand. Communicate with your fellow citizens! Odds are, someone will be able to come assist you. If you will need to log off, feel free to do so. Better yet, let the town know in your Call for Help thread. And if you know, let them know when you'll be back online. Try to include any information you think anyone who might be coming to rescue you will need to know--how much Control Points (CP) are present in the zone, how many zombies there are, what weapons you have, how much AP you have available including food, water and drugs--believe it or not, this is ALL helpful information! Help others, help yourself!<br><br><strong>5) <em><big>ALWAYS</big> use an external map application when scavenging!</em></strong><br><br>If you are going more than 1 AP out from town, take a look at the upper left <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_sites.gif"> icon. Mouse over it, and pick from one of the many options: Atlas, External Map, Dusk2Dawn or Oval Office. If one seems too confusing at first glance, try another one! The idea is to let everyone else in town know <em>what</em> is <em>where</em>. Information is key! Try and get into the habit of "updating" every zone you pass through. It's okay if you miss one once in a while--everyone does. But in more organized towns, having this information available is absolutely critical.<br><br>These apps have been developed for free by D2N players for <em>your</em> benefit! There are even custom-built extensions for your browser that have been created to make it as easy as possible to update these maps with as little effort as possible!<br><br>For Google Chrome users, install this extension:<br><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mcbnodoolliadkflmgoebfepeehmelnj" target="_blank">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detai l/mcbnodoolliadkflmgoebfepeehmelnj</a><br><br>For Firefox users, a very lovely guy named <strong>isaaclw</strong> created an addon to update ALL FOUR of the external map applications with a single click! I use it myself! Click here:<br><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/die2nite-agent/" target="_blank">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox /addon/die2nite-agent/</a><br><br>It's as easy as you could imagine. Post here if you have any questions! I'd be glad to help. Thanks for reading! <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_smile.gif">

                Here is a Mr. Writer that I have toyed with but never used...<br><br><span class="tid_roleplay">Welcome to [Insert Town Name Here]<br><br>If you like your brains and plan to use them please read on. If you have no use for your brains and don’t mind having them devoured by a hungry horde than stop reading and we will make good use of the meaty bone that you leave us.<br><br>Glad you decided to keep reading. The goal of the town is survival. In order to survive all 40 of us need to work together to build the town up securely and to explore outside of the town smartly so no one is left behind.<br><br>The best way to succeed in any town is to always do the following. <br><br>#1 and most important of all is to READ THE FORUMS. The forums are basically the town hall which decides what is to be built, who needs help, plan expeditions and to get to know the other players in the town to get a sense of community. The chalkboard is also a great way to get a quick snapshot of what the town needs and is working on.<br><br>#2 Post on the forums so the town knows that you are active and to let everyone know what you would like to do in the town (build, scavenge or both) If you have any questions, ASK. There is always someone in town that can answer your question or steer you in the right direction.<br><br>#3 Don’t build anything until you have read the forums and understand the build order. This includes Tents and Hovels. There is a time and specific order for everything to be built.<br><br>#4 Don’t take items from the bank and hoard them in your house. This is a great way to get shunned and get a bad reputation in town. Also don’t waste any items in the bank. Throughout the course of the game you will get familiar with what each item does and how they are best used.<br><br>#5 Use your AP wisely. Do not wander aimlessly in the desert, you could get stuck with too many zombies, get thirsty and dehydrate or get too far away from town to get back. It’s always best to go out into the desert with another player and the forums can help you find a traveling companion. If you stay in town use your AP on the current buildings on the chalkboard or in the construction sites thread on the forum. If you have a question on what to do with your AP always ask in the forums first before wasting them on something that may not be necessary yet.<br><br>Remember these 5<br>And stay Alive!<br><br>Glad to have you here and hope to have a long stay in this town with you. We are here to help and have many more things to teach you and fun things to try. Making you a better player makes the town a better town. Nobody wants to die2nite.<br><br>Good Luck.<br>[Mentor Name/Mentor Coalition Name]</span>

                This is just a quick guide to success for the new guys.<br><br>1. Read the forums <em>extensively</em>!<br>You'll get good info on what needs to be done and what's going on.<br><br>2. Listen to what the more experienced players in town have to say.<br>People like me with soul scores closer to 100 know what they're doing, you know...<br><br>3. Don't do other players personal favors<br>Unless they're coalition buddies who are in with you, don't help random players out with personal favors...<br><br>4. DO help people with projects on the town<br>It gets us more buildings and stuff, and ultimately helps us all last longer.<br><br>5. Check souls<br>If you see someone do something that's seemingly random, checking their soul to see what they've done in the past is really telling. Especially if they've been shunned before. This is very important if you intend to be vocal on the forums. <br>Sorry for my stupid mistake of double posting, by the way.

                After dying a very stupid death (we just build the Reactor and we wanted to die by it, except after camping I got stuck and died outside), I "punished" myself by joining a Small Town, while the rest of my coalition got their Atomic Death distinction.<br><br>I made a single post that if people had questions, they could just post them and I would try to answer them.<br>It worked pretty good and I met some players with great potential. I just didn't want to be the guy who tells people what to do.<br>We didn't survive long, due to a serious lack of resources. I had the feeling that I was one of the few scavenging.<br><br>Maybe I'll post a combination of the above, so there will be more activity in town.<br><br>Thx!

                When I join small towns the most important thing imo is to keep anything you post as <em>short and simple as possible.</em> Sometimes I'm honestly overwhelmed by the pages of information(literally) that people post. The following is one of my copy/pasters and is also the longest one I have. The title is obviously meant for serious players BUT it also functions as a LURE for others to make people read what I have to say<img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_blink.gif"> (Gotta abuse human curiosity!) Out of the 3 small towns I've been in recently, I've had 3-5 people use Dusk after I posted this each time. (Yes I spread Dusk Propaganda)<br><br><br><strong>Title: For Serious Players.</strong><br><br>One of the most important things to do when exploring and scavenging on the field is to use one of the External Map Apps to update items and zombie count in zones at the top left of your screen <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_sites.gif"> or just click here:<br><br>(Insert Link)<br><br>This is CRUCIAL for town survival and is expected once you reach 100SP Distant Region Towns. All you have to do is Press the "Update" button and 2 seconds later its done!

                I used to send mass emails to small maps before this thread went up but I got out of practice. Probably too smug to continue when I saw this thread. xD Mostly what I do depends on the people in the town. For example, when someone became a hero I posted this: Welcome to being a hero! Now you get access to upgrades depending on how many days you've been a hero, the three standard hero abilities, and can post on the World Forums.<br><br><cite>If ever there's anything you need to know from mechanics to strategy there's always the help section on the World Forums. Myself and some others are always willing to answer questions.<br><br>Got suggestions on new and exiting places you think Die2Nite could go? You can post them in the Discussions section of the World Forums. <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_blink.gif"><br><br>Lastly, there's the Saloon. It's hard to nail down exactly what it's about but it's pretty much everything else that's related to Die2Nite. We talk about upcoming events, role play, and generally have fun. Just remember the forum rules. <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_smile.gif"><br><br>If you want some tips on what to do as a hero feel free to ask, or, if you'd rather and I perfectly understand why you might, you can feel free to explore and discover it for yourself. <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_lol.gif"><br><br>Welcome to being a hero, and to being a Guardian--my favourite class. </cite><br><br>I remember in my last town there were so many inactives but a few <em>very </em>new players so I posted a thread about where people serious about playing the game could go to continue. I suggested some coalitions be formed and paid attention any past arguments they had been in so that I wouldn't suggest two enemies play together. As far as I know there's 2 coalitions now working their way to large maps. If it wasn't for them that town would have been a let down. No FoD points at all! D:

                Hi guys! I usually make a new thread in the Town Forums with a little list of "Don't do" and then sent a global pm with a simplest copy of this list (without the explanations) and the link to the thread. I'm thinking in add a "do" list also.<br><br><br><cite>First of all, I want to say I'm not an expert in this game, so my word isn't final or something like that. I just want to make some list to the players who don't have so much gaming experience and don't know some simple mechanics of the game and the life in a town.<br>Please feel free to post you own personal ideas and opinions.<br><br><br>- <strong>Read the forums.</strong> Top in my list, every decision must be taken in group.<br>- Don't use water guns. There's another methods to kill the zombies that our precious water.<br>- <strong>Don't mix Pharmaceutical Products.</strong> Let a hero mix them in the lab, the chances of obtaining something useful are much better.<br>- <strong>Don't use Anabolic Steroids, Vodka, Electronic Component or Järpen Table.</strong> We need them for very fundamental buildings, and they're hard to find.<br>- <strong>Ask before build something.</strong> We need to agree in what and what not to build. Portal Lock is a waste of Ap fo example, and also you can waste some important item and the people can be very mad about that.<br>- <strong>Wait for a scout to inspect the zombie zones and then go to search/camp.</strong> Is very annoying (and a waste of AP's) rescue six people per day who easily can search in a safe place.<br>- <strong>Don't camp without the best chances.</strong> I know the distinction is nice but we need the people alive. And ask for help upgrading the place, don't just waste your AP's and go to sleep.<br>- <strong>Don't put complaints just for fun</strong>. Every one makes mistakes and noone born playin Die2nite. So please, first teach.<br>- <strong>Don't build weapons without asking.</strong> Mk.II distinction? Very nice, but if you doing alone, an angry crowd will hunt you.<br>- <strong>Update the map.</strong> We are using From Dusk Till Dawn and is very helpful for grab important items in the desert. Nobody likes to go far for a N&amp;B and instead find some plastic bags. If you don't know how to use it , just ask.<br>- <strong>Stay alive please.</strong> Don't go to camp just for fun or get drunk or get high or fall asleep and forgot to enter. If we want to rank (very difficult without a meta) we need the people healthy and ready for some zombie ass kicking the next day. </cite>

Also, there are water based defensive structures that actually use the water in the well as ammunition. Suppose your town has one of these structures, but the zed numbers are so low tonight, that you actually don't need it to fire. Well, you can't stop it. It will fire at them and it will waste your precious water. Unless, of course, it has nothing to fire with. That's why all the water from the well should be kept in the bank.

As they give a camping penalty of roughly <strong><em>6%</em></strong> each! (Reduced if you're a <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_ranger.gif" alt=":hordes_eclair:" class="tid_ico"> though), so you should ALWAYS try to clear your building of zombies with weapons before camping there!</p><p><strong>Try to avoid camping repeatedly before town devastation</strong></p><p>You want to try to avoid doing this as each night you camp means you have a camping penalty!

So they're well worth taking out with you.<br><br>And... Finally:<br><br><strong>When the zombie attacks get too big, go outside and camp!</strong><br><br><br>When the attacks get too big for you to stay in town, the best thing to do is to go out and camp beyond the towns life, you will be able to rack up extra soul points for yourself, which means you can get to the distant regions even faster!<br><br>Although camping post-town devastation does come with a 70% camping penalty, you can still survive for a couple of extra nights out of town despite this penalty and rack up some nice soul points, and, if your camping post devastation beyond Day 10 you get a <em>Rare Distinction</em> called <em>Zen Camper</em> for each night post devastation you survive, which is a very desirable distinction!<br><br>So, there ya have it, a (not so) quick guide to camping!</p>

Searching in depleted zones only yields low quality resources, or, in other words, rotting logs and scrap metal. Generally searching 9 <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_pa.gif" alt=":hordes_pa:" class="tid_ico"> outside is the best place to start, maybe not on these smaller maps, but once you get to the distant regions, then it's the only way to scavenge!</p><p><strong>Auto Search!</strong></p><p>The Best way to scavenge is actually the way which doesn't actually use <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_pa.gif" alt=":hordes_pa:" class="tid_ico">!, Every 2 hours, you automatically search a zone, without having to do anything! So you can go off straight after the attack, start searching, go off and do your everyday things and then come back online, as you're preparing to return to town and see what goodies you have found! Of course, if you can get on in the intervening time, and you see your zone has depleted, then you should move on!</p><p><strong>Update the External Maps!</strong></p><p>Please Remember to update the external maps in <em>every zone</em> you visit, you can do this in a few different ways, go to the map application of your towns choice in the <em>Directory</em> <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_sites.gif" alt=":hordes_annu:" class="tid_ico"> and update it from that site itself (The map apps are <em>Map Viewer, Dusk Till Dawn, External Map, Cartographer and Atlas)</em>, or, if you're using Chrome or Firefox, then you can download an addon to update all 5 for you! The links to them are also in the directory <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_sites.gif" alt=":hordes_annu:" class="tid_ico">, they're called Die2nite Agent CH and FF respectively.</p><p><strong>Leave Stuff in the zone you found it in on the way out!</strong></p><p>There's no point dragging stuff further from town, so if you find something as you walk to the spot you're planning to Auto search in for the day (updating the map apps on the way, naturally), you can then let someone else pick it up on the way in from their trip, or indeed your trip, if you find nothing better! Everyone will be able to see where everything as you've all updated the map app, right? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Check your Thirst Status!</strong></p><p>In this game, you have a thirst counter, and you have to drink to live (much like real life), and for every 11 steps in the world beyond, you will decrease a thirst level, and if you have not drank that day, the next day you will wake up a thirst level down, so you have to plan your drinking and eating around your scavenging, otherwise you’ll end up dehydrated at a bad time, and will be stuck out in the world beyond, as to get off of dehydrated you have to drink a ration, but you don’t regain any <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_pa.gif" alt=":hordes_pa:" class="tid_ico"> from it!.</p><p>So what do you do? Eating followed by Drinking is the general rule, but if you're going on a long range expo make sure to check out the <em>Zombie Survival Almanac</em> and it's <em>Dehydration Guides</em> created by <em>Annette</em> and <em>Sense</em>, available by going to the <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_sites.gif" alt=":hordes_annu:" class="tid_ico"> or by clicking this <a target="_blank" href="http://annetteannette.net/die2nite/almanac/dehydration.html">link.</a></p><p><strong>Don’t Scavenge in zones with lots of zombies!</strong></p><p>You’ll get trapped by the zombies in a zone if there are more than 2 zombies in a zone, so don’t go and wander into a zone with multiple zombies in! If you however, get to a stage in the game where there are too many zombies around the town to go out solo scavenging, then team up! Your control points will increase by 2 for each citizen in the zone with you, so when you have enough control points you will be able to search! You can then coordinate getting back to town by either setting a time you’ll leave together in, or, if one of you is lucky enough to be a hero, by winning hero or purchasing it, you can leave your character on escort and they can be escorted home for you, so you don’t even have to log in again that day! However, it’s worth remembering that if you lose control of the zone at some point, your search will be interrupted, meaning you can’t search or auto search that zone again for that day.</p><p>There are things that do increase your zone control points, and being a Guardian <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_guard.gif" alt=":hordes_gard:" class="tid_ico"> or unlocking certain perks can also allow you to search in even more heavily infested areas, too!</p><p><strong>Don't Die!</strong></p><p>This should be pretty obvious, but don't forget to come back to town!</p><p>If you don't think you will be able to log on again to get back home from your scavenging trip, then DO NOT go outside and search, a dead person is no use to the town! You can just throw your <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_pa.gif" alt=":hordes_pa:" class="tid_ico"> into the appropriate construction project of the day <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So, that's it, Scavenging 101, Hope you've found it helpful!</p>

Start a Forum thread in your town. Send messages from your home to your town mates. Send message to your townmates via Twinoid PM. Find and or start a town IRC chat. Be patient when your trying to get an answer, you may be running out of time but others may just be busy.</p><p>2 Make yourself available during busy time for die2nite activity<br><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"> Your entire d2n experience is directed by the attack - clock time 2300. That means that 2100 - 0100 is the busy time for most players on d2n. Things need to get done right before attack, others need to happen right after the attack. If you play during 2100-0100 game time your most likely to be asked to do one of the jobs</p><p>3 Set yourself &amp; townmates up to succeed<br><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"> "I went 9ap to AS, Tamers are suppose to kill zeds". Horrible excuse and the laziest way to play the game. Yes you help the town but did you really help your townmates? How about setting food or a booster out for your town mates on your way to an AS spot. How aboutgoing with them on their killing run and bringing more weapons? The point is be available to do more than AS in a safe zone.</p><p>4 See a job, Get the job done and get back in town<br><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"> Look for a construction list, look for a scavenge list, figure out or ask others what does the town need today. Day 2, heros need materials for labs/kitchens - go get it bring it back, sorry you dont get to AS today but you got the town moving. Less than 20 irons in bank, pick a path on from dusk til dawn that gets you to AS and pick up as many irons as possible. All the Washers and hurl sticks broke, fix theim. Sometimes you dont have to wait for others to tell you what to do. Sometimes no one is around to help you decide what to do. See a job, Get it done.</p><p>#1 <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":tid_razz:" class="tid_ico"> I know I can be impatient and demanding <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":tid_razz:" class="tid_ico"><br>so even as i wrote be patient i was laughing at myself[/cite]<br>Die2nite is about residents doing 5 jobs before the attack</p><p><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"> Scavenging <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"> Zed Clearing <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"> Ruin Exploration <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"><br><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"> Building <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"> Camping <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Everything else falls under 1 of these categories<br>When a resident Auto searches at 18km they also Scouted that far<br>When a resident clears a campsite its "safe" for camping</p><p>As residents you can choose to do all jobs or specialize in one<br>A long lasting town communicates with 40 residents to do all</p><p>I say residents cause that is what we all are whether we pay for this game or not.

                <p>I think it should be everyone's good karma deed to ,when they arrive in a town, especially a random one, to make a post alerting people to what is going on in the World of Die2nite - the Contests and the Events and anything else, Tibes Radio show, If there is a facebook contest, anything! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/yeah.png" alt=":youpi:" class="tid_ico"> <br>Normally I entitle my Town post as "win free hero days" with a link to all the WF posts and some encouragement.</p><p>If everyone was wiling to do this, even every second town they are in, I think we will see lots more participation!
