                <p><em>This will be a continuing Novella written by me, telling the story of one man, and his encounters and adventures based on a zombie apocalypse that afflicts the world.<br><br>This is the story of John Crandon. A Biologist and Doctor working for a classified wing of the Center for Disease Control (CDC) "Special Hazards Unit"....<br><br>He has no REAL idea of what he's involved in...</em></p><br><br><br><br><br><p>"Hey John." Sean Astor, the young red headed colleague of mine greeted me as he entered the lab with his usual bottle of mineral water.</p><p>"Did you catch the latest episode of Big Bang Theory last night? Freaking hilarious." He said as I didn't bother to lift me eye from the electron microscope I was peering into.</p><p>"Nope." Was all I said, staring at the unusual behavior of the latest tissue sample I had received.</p><p>Sean came around, wearing his white lab coat unbuttoned, his tie disheveled. Sean was a 'free spirit' scientist. Didn't care much for appearances, but he was a damn fine Doctor and Micro-Biologist.</p><p>Kids these days.</p><p>I was only in my low thirties, but it seemed Stanford, Harvard and even MIT cranked out younger and younger brilliant minds.</p><p>Maybe I just felt like I was getting old.</p><p>"Should have seen it John. Wil Wheaton made another guest appearance, freakin' hilarious!"</p><br><p>I finally lifted my eye from the microscope and looked at him.</p><p>"That's great Sean, maybe I'll catch it on my DVR." I pulled him aside.</p><p>"Aren't you concerned in the slightest with the addition of the Military involvement in our work?" I asked him.</p><p>Since we were given 'Project Valhalla', a Military contingent was assigned to watch over us in the Special Hazards Unit.</p><p>He looked at me curiously. "No John. Why should I be concerned? Our classified wing of the CDC routinely handles Federal, Military, CIA and FBI cases. We've had military oversight before."</p><p>I met his eyes. "Yes....but we've NEVER had armed, black leather suited military personnel standing over our shoulders."</p><p>I nodded toward the female Soldier that stood at our laboratory entrance, gripping an assault rifle.</p><p>Sean followed my gesture and looked at the woman. She stared back at us blankly, but I saw her tighten her grip on her gun.</p><p>"You're being paranoid John! I thought you figured ME for the type to buy into conspiracy theories...so unlike you to..."</p><br><p>The door opened and the female soldier stood aside.</p><p>A man in military uniform entered. The female soldier guarding us at the door stood at rapt attention upon his entrance.</p><p>He was a tall man, dark haired, maybe forty years old, and sported a dark goatee on his face...unusual for military Officers.</p><p>He regarded the female soldier that was watching over us. "At ease Lieutenant Erin Song." he told her.</p><p>Sean perked up at seeing the military man and his black leather wearing escorts wearing full face helmets.</p><p>"Captain Krass! So good to see you!"</p><p>Krass sneered at him. "Save the pleasantries geek, how goes the samples and the cadaver we provided you and Doctor Crandon?"</p><p>I pushed my way past Sean, getting between them.</p><p>The female soldier, Erin Song, it seemed her name was, tensed and slightly aimed her rifle at me as I got in the Captain's face.</p><p>"The tests have been positive so far Captain." I told him. "But I'm tired of being in the dark! Just what is it that the military wants from this research?! It makes NO SENSE! You have us working on cadavers, and reverse engineering diseases!"</p><p>Krass didn't back down and snarled at me. "You will research what your superiors TELL you to research Doctor Crandon! And as a fully authorized superior, you will report to ME!"</p><p>I wanted to punch the guy, but that wasn't really my nature. I was in this field to BETTER Human Kind, not make Bio-Weapons, which is what I suspected we were doing, under the guise of anti-aging research.</p><p>Krass stared back at me with black eyes. "Have you deciphered the Genetic string algorithm, that is key to post-mortum sustainment Doctor Crandon?" He hissed.</p><p>I stared back.</p><p>"Maybe...maybe not. It would be DAMN helpHful if I had a base line to go off of Captain Krass! Just what are you hiding from us!? Don't feed me more bullshit that this is an anti-aging drug, I know better!"</p><br><p>He smiled at me. "It is a natural anti-biotic Doctor Crandon...just like we told your team...a way for American soldiers to fight off foreign diseases without inoculation....nothing more....Now, do you have the Algorithm?"</p><p>I kept my gaze on him.</p><p>"Yes. But it is unproven. If you would give Sean and I some space, we can test the theory."</p><br><p>Krass also held my gaze. "You will use the cadaver we provided?"</p><p>"Yes, we will...as soon as you and your spooks bug the hell out of my Lab!"</p><p>"Very well Doctor Crandon. You may proceed."</p><p>Krass retreated, but looked at Lieutenant Erin Song at the door. "Stay here Lieutenant. Watch them."</p><p>She saluted her superior. "Yes sir." she said in a British accent.</p><p>Curious.</p><p>Krass and his goons left. I looked at Sean. "Ok, I think we can proceed with the test Sean. Administer the serum into cadaver subject A."</p><p>He grabbed the syringe full of the material I developed to control degradation of human cells. It was an experimental material designed, as they asked, to slow the destruction of human cell structure.</p><p>They claimed it was designed as an anti-aging serum, to keep young, viable soldiers in their prime longer.</p><p>I, unlike my colleague Sean, didn't trust the Government. I figured there was more to this than they were letting on....telling us. There was a DIFFERENT reason why they wanted me to develop this cell degradation formula.</p><p>I did it, but I kept the formula off of paper. I kept it in my mind. If the Government had ulterior motives for this anti-degradation formula, I didn't want to just give it to them.</p><br><p>"Preparing to administer to Cadaver A." Sean said, approaching the body on the table in our lab.</p><p>Lieutenant Song watched from the door.</p><p>"Administering now." Sean said, plunging the needle into the first cadaver's neck.</p><br><p>"GRAAAHHHRRRR!!!"</p><p>The cadaver reanimated and grabbed Sean, pulling him down, and bit into his neck.</p><p>Blood sprayed across the wall as the dead body reanimated.</p><p>"What the bloody HELL!?" Officer Song yelled.</p><p>The cadaver ripped out Sean's throat, then tossed him aside.</p><p>"Biological containment breach!" I yelled.</p><br><p>Klaxon's began to ring out across the CDC.</p><p>Bwahh! Bwahh! Bwahh!</p><br><p>The cadaver lunged at me. It's lips and teeth soaked with Sean's blood.</p><p>"Get DOWN DOCTOR Crandon!" Officer Song shouted.</p><p>I ducked.</p><p>Song opened fire and sprayed Cadaver # 1 with bullets....It didn't fall.</p><p>"Shit!" she cried out. "What is THAT thing!?"</p><p>The cadaver scrambled across the floor and slid under the examination table, trying to grab at me.</p><p>What the hell was happening!?</p><p>The dead cadaver was reanimated and coming after all of us in the room!</p><p>I scrambled back into a corner, and the cadaver leaped at me, going for my throat!</p><p>Officer Song shot it in the head, and it fell dead to the floor.</p><p>I looked up at her. "Thank you soldier." I said.</p><p>She looked back at me. "Don't mention it, but I must report to Krass, my commander."</p><p>"Do what you gotta do lady." I said.</p><br><p>"Lieutenant Song to Captain Krass...come in." she said, tapping her breast mounted Comm.</p><p>"Captain Krass here Lieutenant Song, report."</p><br><p>"Subject A awoke, from the dead, and attacked Doctor Astor, killing him! I have neutralized the threat sir, I have Doctor Crandon in my care, please advise!"</p><p>A long silence....</p><br><p>"Officer Song...you and Doctor Crandon are irreparably CONTAMINATED. Prepare for cleansing." Krass replied.</p><br><p>I looked at the female soldier. "Contaminated?! What the HELL does he mean!?"</p><br><p>She eyed me. "It means Doctor, that this outbreak is in us...and they intend to kill us."</p><p>"What!? Just WHAT have you people been working on!?"</p><p>"I'm just a soldier Crandon! You are the Doctor! You tell me! But I'm not going to let my own superiors kill me...come with me if you want to live!" She said, running out of the lab.</p><p>Officer Song and I ran through the CDC complex, she leading me, her weapon drawn.</p><p>We reached the front doors and stepped into the outside world.....</p><br><br><p>"Gnarrrghhhhh!!!"</p><br><br><p>A virtual wall of undead cadavers stood before us.</p><p>The entire city of Atlanta Georgia was undead corpses....</p><br><br><p>The corpses rushed Officer Song and I.....</p><br><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiHPlCLfXWo">Episode 1 closing Music</a></p><br><p><strong>To be continued.....</strong></p>
