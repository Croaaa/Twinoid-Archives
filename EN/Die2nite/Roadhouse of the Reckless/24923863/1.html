                <p>Ghouls make up a big part of this and last season. Yet, not a lot can be read about them. They are evil and mysterious creatures and not everyone will ever be a ghoul in this game. Storytelling about your experiences as a ghoul is one way to share the experience with others. I would love to read more about how ghouls acted to pull of their mischief and inflict harm on their fellow citizens, what choices they made, what they were feeling and what/who they watched out for.</p><p>Anyway, here is my own story about a devilish ghoul with an appetite for LMS...</p><p>===</p><p><em>Interviewer</em>: off the bat, congratulations with your LMS, or LGS, haha.</p><p><strong>Ghoul</strong>: <em>insert bored look</em> Thank you</p><p><em>Interviewer</em>: we hear some people were pretty pissed off with what you pulled off. Looks like not only did you devour four citizens, you also slaughtered the other inhabitants by opening the town gates.</p><p><strong>Ghoul</strong>: despite people "knowing" <em>chuckle</em> that I was not the ghoul, they still did not like me very much. A gallows was constructed and I had more complaints than a famous serial griefer in our town. If the town survived another night, there was a considerable risk I would have been marched off to the gallows. The town had to die.</p><p><em>Interviewer</em>: the way I understood it, the town had quite the appetite for shunning</p><p><strong>Ghoul</strong>: you could say that! Quite frankly, even eyeing someone the wrong way was cause for a complaint. I wrote a funny note to a fellow citizen and got a complaint in return. Posted something else on the forum and there was another. Packed stuff for an expedition -- tag! another one. Best thing to do was lay low and not be heard.<br><br><em>Interviewer</em>: so everyone was quiet?<br><br><strong>Ghoul</strong>: not exactly. We had a number of aggressive and vocal citizens. They were gathering complaints at a rapid pace as well.<br><br><em>Interviewer</em>: what were they vocal about?<br><br><strong>Ghoul</strong>: well, we had a ghoul in town. Not me, I wasn't a ghoul back then, but someone else. On day 2 and 3 this ghoul struck. As you can imagine, there was quite the level of paranoia. I am a pretty decent ghoul hunter, but I had no clue who it could have been. The ghoul acted smart.<br><br><em>Interviewer</em>: but not smart enough to strike after day 3?<br><br><strong>Ghoul</strong>: indeed. The ghoul died in a freak accident. Our walls were sturdy, and yet a zombie squeezed itself through an unknown opening in our defences and out of all possible victims chose the ghoul.<br><br><em>Interviewer</em>: I bet the town was relieved after that, weren't they?<br><br><strong>Ghoul</strong>: they did not notice. For all they knew, the ghoul was still active. I looked through his house, however, and knew for certain that he was the ghoul.<br><br><em>Interviewer</em>: that's quite incredible. How did you become ghoul then?<br><br><strong>Ghoul</strong>: hehe, I took his place. Not a bit later, I found a traveller's corpse. A plan started to form, which worked like a charm. On the forum I submitted the proposal to punch everyone just once to see if they were the ghoul. People who had been punched would be safe. I volunteered to go first.<br><br><em>Interviewer</em>: no way. Did they buy that?<br><br><strong>Ghoul</strong>: yes, most definitely. People were punched with much enthousiasm. Right after I was punched and proved my innocence, I ate the corpse and become the successor to the ghoul. <br><br><em>Interviewer</em>: with an appetite, I presume?<br><br><strong>Ghoul</strong>: a fully sated one. On day 4, I killed the only other hero in town to prevent her from reading my timeline. On day 5, I grabbed and killed another citizen.<br><br><em>Interviewer</em>: but you were still considered innocent?<br><br><strong>Ghoul</strong>: yes. A frenzied witchhunt ensued with lots of people being punched and others bickering over the process of punching and whether it was worthwhile or just a waste of AP. People got wounded as well. The list was considered holy writ and those once punched were not accused again.<br><br><em>Interviewer</em>: were people still scavenging outside at that point?<br><br><strong>Ghoul</strong>: They were not. The fear was complete. A fellow citizen proposed to have an expedition to the Abandoned Bunker. As you can imagine, I volunteered to go along. We were a group of three. One of the expedition members that went inside was wounded by the numerous zombies in the complex. Both decided to camp.<br><br><em>Interviewer</em>: did you eat them?<br><br><strong>Ghoul</strong>: it was too risky to eat them there. Instead, I went back to town. Half an hour before the attack, I hoarded lots of defensive objects. Minutes before the attack, I devoured the serial griefer, who also had the highest home defense. I really hated that guy, so that was probably the only emotional decision I took in that town. The gates were closed, but I reopened them again.<br><br><em>Interviewer</em>: and after the attack, you looked on your work?<br><br><strong>Ghoul</strong>: I did indeed. Everyone was dead, except for one of the expedition members, 11 AP from town. To ban out all risks, I went there and devoured him as well.<br><br><em>Interviewer</em>: I see. You sit here in this lonely town, at a table, a candle burning. What do you expect the zombies will do to you?<br><br><strong>Ghoul</strong>: do to me? how can they not view me as a friend? <em>looks around anxiously</em><br> <br><em>Interviewer</em>: … ehm, ok… good luck to you then! <em>puts on a fake smile</em></p>

                <p>I guess I'll tell my tale.</p><p>I was a ghoul in a distant town. It didn't start of well. Lots of early deaths, no zed clearance. I got myself stuck and injured, no one would help.</p><p>So I made it back to town, but on the way I found a corpse.</p><p>There was no parecetoid left, and I saw it as a way to save my life. After all I thought, I'll explain in town what had happened, and make a request for meaty bones...</p><p>But when I got back an evil thought came over me. This town hadn't helped me, so why should I help them?</p><p>This was day 4. The town was already dying. Two people were about to die of dehydration. So I waited.</p><p>Then one minute before the attack I struck, eating the soon to be dead. He didn't bother to log in, so I took his life. I expected myself to be dead as soon as the attack was over.</p><p>But I wasn't.</p><p>Logged back in 8 hours later to find that no one had noticed. I reread the register and there was my name. Why had noone mentioned this?</p><p>So I mentioned this is a post, explaining my reasoning and reassuring others I wasn't a threat. I ate a corpse that was still lying in town. I was in no danger of starving.</p><p>But then I had another idea. I could be an instant Sheriff. No complaints were needed, no waiting. My teeth were instant justice.</p><p>I searched the logs for a candidate. It didn't take long. 22 defence on day 5. A man who only logged on to improve his own chances. Before the attack I feasted again.</p><p>That was the end of my brief time as a Ghoul. The attack the next day was too much and we were wiped out. Apathy was a much more damaging killer than I ever was...</p>

I was extremely drunk, but even I could tell what was going to happen. He lunged straight at me, laughing. He sunk his teeth into my arm. It was so painful... I tried to fight back, oh I tried...</p><p>And the worst part of the dream? He leaves halfway in the middle of the attack. I lied on the ground, bleeding and missing an arm. And the dream ends once I die the horrible death I must have suffered.</p>

Hardcore towns aren't kind to the infected.</p><p>So I nommed my corpse, cured my injury and infection and became a hugely popular fellow in the town.</p><p>I was that guy who didn't drink the rapidly depleted rations, the guy who cleared dead bodies from houses for free. I was the guaranteed survivor on the watch. In the final hours, I was able to walk 50 ap in the desert, loaded up on drugs with no fear of dehydration, the meaty bones and souls were all mine.</p><p>What did I learn was that the most effective part of being a ghoul is the threat of eating someone, not the eating itself....</p><p>I am the ghoul who ate no one.</p>

I find absolutely nothing of value up there. Four clicks north of town there was a <em>Plane Crash Site</em> that five other citizens<img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_human.gif" alt=":hordes_humain:" class="tid_ico"> had flocked to; I was the fifth person to find nothing special. But, ya know, timber is timber- it just needs some effort to be worthwile.<img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_refine.gif" alt=":hordes_atelier:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I headed south after searching for six hours, finding only <strong>Rotting Logs</strong> and a <strong>Twisted Plank</strong> does little for <em>Day 1</em> Morale so I decided to take a detour.

                <p>I am traveling across the barren sands after a hard day's work of being one of the main town planners. I find a traveler's corpse and an wry grin appears on my face. I devouring it chanting to the spirits, did I mention I'm the shaman, to give me an awakened body and they do not disappoint. I spy a fellow companion searching through the sands, but I control my hunger. I had just left the gates, best to wait a few hours. A few hours later, I clamp down on my fellow citizen. I drop my water which is now useless and put some distance between myself and the crime scene, waiting yet again a few more hours. Returning to town, I notice one overly zealous citizen has gone around punching citizens who took meaty bones from the bank. I grin and note not to take bones from the bank. I am planning on donating my gnawed corpse in an unsuspecting scapegoat's chest when I hear "roobee's the ghoul!". I raise my eyebrows, what miscalculation did I do? This citizen says that I admitted to him I was a ghoul. I search my memories and groan on the inside. The previous day, back when I was a mere mortal, this citizen had asked me what I enjoyed doing. I replied by saying I deeply wished to become a ghoul, but I had never been one in any of my past incarnations. I tried explaining that just because I wanted to be a ghoul didn't mean I was one, but logic did not work on him and I was slayed. Ironically, he correctly deduced I was a ghoul, but with flawed reasoning. But my incarnations shall rise again, and if the spirits are in my favor, one of them will once again become an awakened one.</p>
