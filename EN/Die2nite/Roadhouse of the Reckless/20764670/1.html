                <p>Hi everybody, I just got a Hardcore LMS and won some hero days, and the way it happened made me want to do a quick story, cause I really love the Roleplay Texts. So please read and tell me what you think, here it goes:</p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">SufferME</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay"> <br><strong>Ghoul diaries: THE LOST ONE</strong><br><br>Diary log, Day 5:<br>The situation in town is dire; half the citizens we had gathered are dead. We're low on water and we haven't had food in days. I even tried eating some of those strange mushroom berries that grow around the pit where we dump the zombie sludge.<br><br>Mashed a bunch up into a puree, cooked it on a piece of sheet metal over a torch with a bit of leftover grease out of those gnarly old open cans, heh must have been a chief in a past life. It turned out delicious; I’m not going to tell any of the others more food for me.<br><br>...<br><br>So maybe the fleshrooms were a bad idea. My stomach has been killing me all day, and I can't make it stop. On top of that I've developed a rash. It itches; maybe I've got a minor allergy to them. Could life get any worse?<br><br>Dairy log, day 6:<br>My damn stomach, I've never felt pain like this. It's a more steady and a throbbing pain now, but last night I feel like it was tearing me apart, like I was going to die. I screamed so much, though we had a major horde attack last night, so no came to check on me. The town looks like a wreck, I need to check it.<br><br>...<br><br>Oh god, oh god, oh please no. What is wrong with me, I just and it was good. Too good. If I got some seasoning, or if it was moving. OH GOD! Why did I just think that!<br><br>…<br><br>Ok, I’ve got a hold of myself… The attack was much worse last night then it should have been, almost everyone is dead. There are 4 of us left. We set about cleaning up the bodies and fixing up the town. I was on body duty, the zombies leave a mess but sometimes people still come back. For some reason I couldn’t help but stare at the meat going to waste. At the final hovel… I could help myself… I tried it, just a bite, but then I couldn’t stop. I ate all of it every little bit. I’m so horrible. The pain in my stomach is a little better though, and I can’t help but stare at the other citizens left. I’m a monster. I need to go out and scavenge; I need some time to think.<br><br>…<br><br>I’ve become a monster, I know that now. The water I spill on myself burned. I’m a zombie already, infected, maybe dead, but I’ve kept my intelligence somehow. Those fleshrooms must have been poisonous and killed me. Why do I still have a pulse? When I was out there a citizen joined me, we made ideal chit chat, trying to avoid the fact of how obviously doomed the town was. Then he cut himself on some scrap metal, and it smelled so good. While he was tending to it he never saw me behind him with the log in my hand. He never had a chance. I’ve never felt such a thrill, or tasted such a delicious meal, so fresh, still warm, pure delight and pleasure. The pain in my stomach is gone completely too. I snuck back into town the other 2 have no idea, they think he abandoned us. We’re preparing to make war tonight, fight off as many as we can. I wonder if the zombies will try to eat me still or recognize me as one of their own. I know the town is doomed; I’ll fight hard even if all I can think about is joining the other like me in the feast.<br><br>Diary log, day 7:<br>My undead brethren tried to eat ME! Those bastards! Night fell, the hunger and pain started to overtake me; then they appeared in an almighty horde bigger than I have ever seen there must have been 300 of them or more. They flowed in over our meager defense; the 3 of us fought hard outnumbered a 100 to 1. They were obviously more interested in the other 2, but still some thought they could eat me. They don’t understand I DO THE EATING NOW! MY hunger and pain turned to rage as we were driven back to our defended hovels. I fought and killed so many. One of the citizens got overrun and torn apart. But then the sun rose and the remaining zombies retreated, we’d won. My anger at them receded and I was left with the throbbing pain of my stomach. The last citizen was putting his weapons away in the bank when I jumped on his back and sank my teeth into his neck, no weapons this time, a pure kill. It was even tastier then the last, I’ve never experienced something so primal, exhilarating, euphoric!! After that I ate the remains of the other that the brainless ones had left behind. Those fools… It was bland and unappetizing by comparison… Hmmm now I’m alone.<br><br>…<br><br>I need to find more prey, and not just as food, they are protection too. I might be worth 150 or more of those locust out there, but they out number me by much more than that. I’m prepared for a trip. Tonight when the attack comes I’m going to force my way through while they are busy destroying the town. I’ve got two meaty bones to snack on, and a mattress to use as a shield as I shove my way through the horde. My hunger will turn to power I know that now. I’ve made 2 explosive water bombs, 1 to help clear the way and 1 to end it if I fail to get through. I won’t become like them, I won’t lose my mind, I’d rather be slop on the ground. They are MAGGOTS and I’m the MONSTER! I won’t fail, I haven’t eaten enough, I’ve only just begun!<br><br>…<br><br>The attack is coming soon; this will be my last entry. I’ve decided to leave this diary here. It was started for this town and I’m going on to the next one. If someone should find it, then it could help them. They can follow my recipe, and become so much more! A monster, Be Enlightened! Eat the fleshrooms hahaha. It’s the greatest feeling ever; my only regret is that I didn’t start eating the others, when more were around. I’ve decided what to say when I get to the next town. I’ll change my name and start like this:<br><br> “Hello! You there! My names Zed! Don’t attack, I'm friendly! Thank god I’ve found this place; I’ve been wandering the waste for so long. Nice to meet you, uh again my name is Zed. I’ve been out there for days. This? No, it’s a skin condition, I’ve been in the sun far too long, please let me in. Thank you, did I say my name was Zed? Yes? Oh. How I survived out there? I’d love to tell you, but it’s a long story, let’s go for a stroll and scavenge while I tell it. Others? Naw that would be a waste of manpower, I can tell them on a walk tomorrow. Too far from the town? Well why would you scavenge something that could be found by seeing it on the town wall? Haha of course it makes sense. Did I tell you I’m Zed. Yes? We’ll good cause that’s how I survived. What do I mean? Here let me show you.”<br></span></span></p>
