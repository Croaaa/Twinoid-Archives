                <p>For me, the first 5 days of a town are the most exciting. That's the time most zones in 9 AP range of town aren't depleted thus still yielding useful items, and most items found are still in high demand and thus worth bragging that you found. There really isn't much appeal in bragging you found a rotten log when the bank already has over 300 of them.</p><p>Usually in meta towns I play as a tamer, because not only does the town give me permission to use drugs and alcohol and batteries and other breakable weapons to run headlong into zombie-infested zones and probably get stuck and need a rescue, but it's practically a <em>requirement</em> I do so because I'm a tamer. It's also much fun trying to plot the most efficient route through zombie-infested zones to be able to kill as many zombies as possible and still make it home safely, with or without rescue. Of course, this is usually for not around day 12 when the spikes are so high I'm trapped inside to build, maybe granted permission to step 1 AP outside town to dig up boring logs and scrap metal. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> After that the most I have to look forward to is trying to be the first to grab the mattresses and trestles out of the bank (or pillage them from the recently deceased) to up my decoration points.</p><p>In season 4 I played a lot as a survivalist in random towns to up my camping distinctions. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Random towns are fun because there's always nearby zombies to kill and zones are always turning up great items in which to break over said zombie's heads. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> And when the first week is over and there's not much fun left, there's also usually not many people left to care you are standing outside to die or eating a cyanide. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cool.png" alt="8)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Lately I've been collecting camping data with which to calculate the bonuses and penalties for various effects with which to build a better camping calculator (granted I didn't know at the time there was already a camping calculator available).</p><p>Eventually I'll go back to building kitchens and playing as a scout for expert expeditions.</p>

                <p>For me the game is really about the people.<br>I mean, you don't really have much to 'do' in the game, just click and wait, yet I spend endless hours logged in chatting to the members of my coalition or refreshing the forums.</p><p>As to the replay value - you end up in good towns and bad towns and with all the different personalities each game is different.<br>When you're in a town with cooperative people where teamwork is top priority and the town forums are bustling with life - that's when the game is absolutely amazing and I sacrifice sleep just to be here.<br>When you're stuck in a town with griefers and people flying solo, when you can't get people to work together - that's when I get frustrated and stop being emotionally invested in the game, just go through the motions.</p><p>The thing I totally dig about this game is the scavenging, the excitement of logging in every 2 hours to check if I've found some drugs or alco which will let me do even more <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>I also have a love-hate relationship with camping <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> It's risky and gets my adrenaline pumping. It's exciting and scary at the same time! In a good town - you don't want to die! Yet sometimes the town's survival hinges on finding a new blueprint...</p><p>It's so fun discovering new items you've never seen before and trying out all the classes. I thought I loved scavenger.... till I tried guardian... loved that till I tried tamer... and now as a survivalist I'm torn <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I love this game because of the social interaction and the need for cooperation.

                <p>Yeah, as stated the game is mostly about the people. I think in terms of exciting, Season 1 was probably the most exciting one for me - slowly getting organized, map apps a lot more rudimentary, no wiki, more zombies on the map....<br>The thing is, the game itself has been the same for 1 and a half years, and it hasn't gotten much more exciting. We know most stuff now, there isn't much left to discover. Sure, ruin runs shake things up a bit, but only every so often.<br>Fortunately, the community is still great and I greatly enjoy bantering in IRC when I'm on and actually reading <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>And why the forums are quieter... I don't really know. I don't dig the new layout, perhaps that's reason enough for some to quit <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>Or no influx of new heroes, because reading through the forums I mostly see names I've seen before...<br>What could change to add Replay Value to D2N? Hard to say... More buildings, more real time events, towns playing against each other...</p>

                <p>The ruins and camping seem like they both would have probably been really cool additions to be around to see <em>(both existed already when I started playing)</em>. I think to keep the game fun and exciting something as original as these additions should be considered for Season 6 <em>(maybe a second town of some form or more mini-game-esque aspects?)</em>.</p><p>And also, as others have mentioned, I love the strong community that exists on here, I think that's one of the things that won me over to buy hero days and play on the regular.
