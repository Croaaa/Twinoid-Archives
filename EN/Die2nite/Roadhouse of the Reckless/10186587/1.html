                Spartie, I believe that your last post in this thread (to derp or not to derp?) is a prime example of what I was talking about the page before.<br><br>You picked a sentence that could be open for interpretation, even though thomas already tried a few times to explain what he actually meant.<br><br>Then you chose to give it the worst possible meaning. You can then pose as a victim and you go nuts with life threatening comparison, blowing the thing out of proportion.<br><br>Yes I found your post relatively offensive and yes I did not send you a very friendly message about it. In retrospect that wasn't very clever of me, that is for sure.<br><br>On top of that, you (singular) did to me what you (plural) did to thomas - choosing to feel attacked and getting far too defensive about it, an attitude which did not help you try to understand the matter at hand. <br><br>Quoting me the world forums rules because I posted mild and friendly criticism about many of the replies in the thread was quite silly in my humble opinion and rather misplaced.<br><br>For indeed it is a pity that you chose to misunderstand friendly criticism and take it for "backhanded snipe at players"! Especially after the mountain of criticism and lectures your lot gave poor thomas!<br><br>It would be lovely if people didn't have to have this type of pack mentality where some feel the need to gang up on anyone dare criticise metas or dare criticise the tiniest thing amongst people in the pack.<br><br>I did not agree with most of what thomas had to say, for the record, but didn't really feel the need to rephrase everything he said to make it sound worse than it was.<br>I do, however, appreciate the general gist of thomas point and I wholeheartedly agree with Spartie when he said the thread <cite>could have been a nudge in the direction of placing responsibility onto the more experienced players to join smaller maps to help people, and metas to consider more seriously the implications of “derp towns”. </cite><br>Instead, we got a few of you obsessing over the fact that thomas used a couple of possibly offensive adjectives if put in another context.<br><br>My posts weren't always helpful and I am far far far far from perfect and even further from avoiding knee jerk reactions. I really enjoyed Sense's posts a lot in that thread though. It's a pity it got locked. Perhaps another healthy discussion can occur in the recent future on similar issues?

                Correction: I was wrong to say that people got too defensive because metas were criticised. That wasn't the case. <br><br>And to be honest I didn't think too much of it when I posted in the derp thread, but seeing Spartie's reaction and the fan mail I got certainly made me think some more about it.<br><br>I hope we can agree to disagree or exchange friendly criticism or share how we interpreted the thread in cordial terms now - despite the not so nice message I sent you Spartie. Do feel free to bite back by private messages, it's only fair!<br><br>Or maybe The Crow will lock or delete this. It was only fair the other one got locked and I might be rude here carrying on about it? I'll take it on the chin.
