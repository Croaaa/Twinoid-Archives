                <p>Even though in email you said "no thanks" for help with some of the questions you have, I will try to help. I'm not sure why, it's a sickness. Like I said on the youtubes, you do not need private towns to play with friends. You do not have to ask MT for "press account" or request to pay for the use of a private town. MT will not make tonnes of money with this service, no one uses private towns. When we want to play with our friends and organize them on Skype lol we just get 8 jumpers together and jump 40 people into a town at once. Or, 20 or 16 or however many people we want. With less than 40 you will get the "character" you want though so why you want private makes no sense to me.</p>

I totally understand you want to play with friends, it's not that complicated. I don't see why you would think you would get the right to pay for a private town though when the rest of us had to pay hero days and wait for the ability.</p><p>But, look, I don't really care!

                <p>No, you pretty clearly called Annette a grumpy player that sent you a message. Granted, you didn't use her name, but listen to what you said and go back to the messages you've got. Somewhere around 50-51 minutes in where you're talking about a grumpy player that sent you an email saying you got this wrong or that wrong... then you went on to say that you did some checking and you think it was a person you killed in a town. Seriously. Go back and listen.</p><p>I'm horribly curious, though, why you're so intent on coming off as knowing what you're talking about when you say <strong>repeatedly</strong> that you're not sure about this or that.</p><p>Expressing an opinion is one thing. Say you don't like meta play or that you hate ghouls or whatever else... but to say that ghouls work this way or hardcore is that way and to get it wrong is an entirely different thing.</p><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_1946006 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1946006">beauhindman</span></span><cite>This is for an organized article.</cite><p>I think this is part of the problem, honestly.

Infection is different, It seriously is, and the wiki doesnt say that. says you can't get infected.</p><br><p>I like MT too <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="tid_ico">But, hope they DONT sell you a mayor town. NoWay , <strong>that is earned</strong>.</p><p>Also I dont think you truly projected what the game is really about and that is the Community. THis is an AWESOME community! We have contests and paody songs and live radio shows and memes! The game is the community, and you barely touch on it.</p><p>Do you read the Forums much? If you did you would probably know by now, we are a solid strong community, on the whole, and we deffo look out for each other, ya really cant go around half-calling out people, specially when they are kinda known ( i think) as Pillars of our community and has an incredible wealth of knowledge. The way you say it makes me think you are just looking for trouble and stir up the pot.</p><p>You talked about fanfiction, and i think there is tons. Currently there is a rockin writing contest going on (world forums again) So many event towns AND organized, serious towns has massive Role Play threads as well.</p><p>Normally I never write a wall of text, nor write <em>anything</em> negitive, like ever, but I did spend an hour of my day listening so you will get my feedback.</p><p>PS. I feel is you actually wanted everyone's feedback you would have posted this in the Residents forum so everyone could have an equal opportunity to comment.</p>

                <p>Joanne,</p><p>Thanks! That podcast was not mine, it was a buddy of mine's. He's just started it and asked me to come on. it's a loose conversation show, and so everything I say or he said will likely not be perfect. That's why comments are looked for! <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I have written about Die2Nite several times and have hosted many livestreams on it, and I never pretend to know everything. I miss a few things, so, again.... that's why comments are so needed. I correct when I can. I do not know the community here just like in any other game I cover (besides a very few) because I have to cover so many in a week I don't have time to hang on the forums. I wish I did, though! Either way, I am more worried about getting the game coverage than hanging on the forums.</p><p>Anyway, like I said I will be having a player who can host a town do it for me unless I can arrange something. We'd need to work out a pretty easy-going town so it can last a while and so new players could learn without getting yelled at. It would be just to show off the game.</p><p>I did originally post the article in another forum and it was moved here. So, I figured this would have to go here as well.

                <p>I listened to the whole thing too and found it very interesting. To be blunt though I would like you hear you do the thing again after you've played a few Theme and Meta towns. Maybe the next Mega Meta Jump would be a good place to start. As others have said I think you are missing the 'community' part of this game. <br>I'm only a mid-level player but I'm sure there were several high-level players that were recoiling at the review. It was a bit ignorant (literal not insulting) of the depths of the game. Maybe you could interview a few of the very active/experienced players in the mean time. MT me if you want a list of people that would be good to interview.<br>Please take this as constructive criticism. No offense intended. Anything that gets the word out about the game is a good thing. Overall it was good for a review by a couple of very casual player.</p>

                <p>I enjoyed the podcast. And to be fair, if Annette hadn't posted I wouldn't have had a clue it was her. Maybe all this should have continued in private. It's not very nice to see a complete bombardment against a player just because he doesn't know everything. These sorts of things c an get the name of the game out there and get new players to join which is what we all want isn't it? (to get more money to MT so they can sort the shit the community has highlighted, staffing etc... bla blah blah.) Plus I did actually really enjoyed the podcast. Like he said it's a conversation between 2 players it's not 'The Complete Survival Guide.'</p><p>Anyway in short I hope to see more from Beau in the future. I find his content very entertaining and if I had never played the game before and read his article or watched one of the videos I would definitely consider playing. And I probably wouldn't be deterred when I get infected in my pursuit of becoming a ghoul.</p>

This game is 90% forum related. The actual gameplay is, to be blunt and honest, boring.

You are confusing my inability to hang out on these larger forums with a refusal to check the town forums (the lil radio icon) while I play. Heck, I've mentioned in my stuff several times how important constant communication is, and the host mentions it VERY specifically in that podcast.</p><p>I am not able to hang out with world forum cliques or do not have time to get to know everybody. Sorry about that. Reading these forums is not a necessity; reading the town forums is.</p><p>As far as interviews with several players, I just don't have enough words in a week to do something like that. Anyway, it's already being put out there as some complicated project; it's not. I aim just to have fun with some readers/gamers and show it off a bit. <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Such a fun game, but damn it's hard to explain without just showing someone!</p><br><p>Beau</p>

He is perpetuating incorrect info by ignorance but my main problem is the untruths about our exchange. As for why I didn't pm him, I emailed him before, Switzerland, I'll never do it again. At first when I heard the podcast I thought he was confused, I didn't realize that the story he was telling was just more cool than the truth. So, he used me for his cute little story and unless it's you I guess you really don't know how that feels. He's publicly said things and I uhh can't do the same? Interesting double standard. He posted it here, I'm going to respond.</p><p>He says some things about the community that are kind of off, because he doesn't write or talk about what he knows but I'm not taking it personally. I know what kind of community we have here, it's great. He is playing at getting a town together, private, to write about and there's nothing wrong with that. It seems to be about the psychology of it all and watching drama unfold. There can be plenty of that for sure. I don't even think he needs to play events to see what this community is about, who wants the drama?</p><p>Do your thing Beau, all I know is you have the credibility of a <span class="tid_preRoleplay">annette</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Giant Rat.</span></span> There's some RP for your friend. : D</p>
