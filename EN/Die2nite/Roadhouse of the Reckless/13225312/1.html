                <p>I know I'm going to get a lot of negative thoughts about this, but here goes:</p><p>I see a lot of anger and resentments in <em>COTT2</em>, way more than in <em>COTT1</em>. I see <strong>selfish</strong> people, <strong>shunned</strong> people and way too many deaths early days.</p><p>I think this <strong>event</strong>, <em>even if created and founded properly</em>, became an excuse for some players to get a distinction, or even a possibility to f<strong>k it up for the others.<br><br>Being a <em>founder</em> in <em>COTT 1</em>, I suggested an 100SP minimum back then, and I think for </strong>COTT 3<strong> that should easily be 500SP. Participants should be Titans anyway.<br><br>I know there were some exceptions, I personally know <em>2 of them</em>, but there were around <em>10 exceptions</em> tops compared to the other 230 dedicated heroes involved in it.<br><br>I honestly think the next </strong>COTT<strong> should be <em>invitational only</em>, and incomplete towns should have a registration page from where town founders choose from.<br><br>But mainly </strong>COTT #3<strong> should be <em>1 Town each class</em>!<br><br>About that <em>invitation list</em>, heroes should be invited into towns taking into account the class they use most. (I.E. I have 2</strong>00+ Scavenging days<strong>, I should be in </strong>Scav Town<strong>).<br><br>I don't want to create a lot of fuss, that's just <em>my 2 cents</em>, but maybe my ideas would help the next </strong>COTT<strong> to be a proper </strong>TITANS event**.<br><br>Please forgive me if my English isn't perfect, but I had to say this.<br><br>Thanks!<br><br>Bercea.</p>

                <p>I think what a lot of it boiled down to this round was that the organizers were somewhat rushed in getting the towns together and with several ideal players backing out for whatever reason and then trying to fill the holes in the town lists it led to more chaos than it should have.</p><p>I liked the way the previous clash was laid out with one town for each class and the organizers were given the time to check out each person who registered (hat tip to you Bercea for your work in the original Scav town).</p><p>In the future every person who confirms should have a minimum of 25 hero days before they are allowed on the list. The SotSS had a citizen who joined with 2 days (likely gained from the MT donation) and proceded to dehydrate today after being rescued in an attempted suicide yesterday and BIA'd twice to prevent him from being shot in the head. He and the other die-for-nothing players like the one who cyanided should be banned from future events.</p><p>My .02</p>

                <p>I myself had 20 days before MT gave out the 2 free ones so at the official start I had 22. I had planned to buy more right after the start of the town (and did). That said, if a player doesnt have enough to make it through right off the bat and theres no system in place to ensure they buy them once they join a town theres really no point in considering that person as someone who is serious about going the distance regardless of their experience or intentions.</p><p>It happened in the first clash and happened again in this clash and it kept out other eligible players who actually had the days purchased to go the distance.</p>

                <p>For the choosing invitation list, I agree that could work, but there has to be a clear rule based on that. A player judging someone on if they are "worthy or not" could be extremely biased, no matter how trusted or how much play time they have under their belt.</p><p>On the other hand, simple feedback (Either positive or constructive) based on personal experiences could be a useful tool in comparison to just looking at someone's profile and seeing if the player has ABC soul points and ABC hero days spent, right?</p><p>Example: BerceaMondialu: 3261 Soul Points.<br>Comments: Excellent Member from COTT with great organisation, was seen in xyz, abc towns and did some things well.- from Kainy.</p><p>Something short and simple like that at the touch of a button (Maybe via OO) when checking whether someone should go into their town for COTT may prevent things like this happening again, of course this could also be biased to a point, but nothing can be perfect.</p><p>Definitely agree on one town per class, I personally think it is not really a Clash of the titans if the real question is which tamer town or which survivalist town wins...</p><p>My 2 cents also <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_calim.gif" alt=":hordes_calim:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>I can understand the desire to improve the experience from what it was this time but I still don't think SP is the problem. Inexperience, while requiring a little more patience and direction, has not been a problem in my town. In fact I don't know that I can identify a problem in my town except for extremely bad luck.</p><p>The "ill will" and various problems seem, at a glance, to be spread among players old and new alike, and I honestly think the despondency or frustration running through some towns has nothing to do with SP limits.</p><p>The biggest problem with this Clash has been organisation - or bad/inconsiderate players that slipped through because of it. I don't wish to harp on it as what's done is done and I want to make this Clash as successful as it can be, but it's just the truth as I see it.</p><p>I think many feel that the whole thing was torpedoed from the start, and honestly I do too but I really want to make the best of it. I'm happy with my town's players and their efforts and I'm excited to continue through the coming days.</p><p>I believe if any limits are to be imposed on the third Clash - assuming MT doesn't just throw in the towel and tell us we can't have one, which I still fear - they should be decided by the town leaders during the screening process.</p><p>Hopefully that process will be given a greater chance to succeed next time.</p>

                <p>I'm not sure having people vetted by other players would work well, as there are some new people in our town who aren't as well known who still seem to be good players. And I'm afraid that it would turn into a popularity contest and wouldn't allow good players who aren't as well known to join.</p><p>Yes, there are people who have caused peoples in town, but that happened unfortunately even with a well-known and well-experienced player.</p><p>I agree that the next clash would be 1 class per town, though. And I think that MT should check to make sure that the person has enough hero days to make it through the clash before the invitation is given, so we don't run into the "resident" issue that we have in this clash and in the past one.</p>

                <p>Without going into too many details, I'd like to weigh in on a small part of what you said BerceaMondialu.</p><p>"Being a founder in COTT 1, I suggested an 100SP minimum back then, and I think for COTT 3 that should easily be 500SP. Participants should be Titans anyway."</p><p>I'm not going to name names or call anyone out, and I'll do my best to get my point across without being aggressive. If it seems otherwise, please know that it's not my intentions. Before Clash started, I was directly attacked in PM by a veteran. It was unprovoked and what could have been a normal discussion resulted in me being called stupid, moronic, etc for no other reason than wanting to take part in CotT2. I wrote it off as him being one bad fish in a large pond.</p><p>I was pretty excited to be involved. I love this game and certainly don't mind supporting it with my money. I felt the opportunity to play with more devoted people who would actually communicate and help one another would be a much better experience over the random towns. Unfortunately, I've taken down more names to avoid during CotT2 than I have during the entire few months I've played. Most are over 1K SP. It's become a battle of egos and nothing more. And while I haven't been at the center or receiving end of any of this, it's disheartening to see so many supposed "Veterans" reduced to petty name calling and harassing one another. I know not all of you are bad, so don't take that as a blanket statement. But if Clash 3 were filled with more of what I've seen so far, Clash of the Egos would be a more appropriate name.</p>

I made a couple of minor mistakes and learned from them. Now I feel I'm really getting the hang of it.

If given enough time to do it, I think perhaps there should be a more in-depth screening process than we had this time, but that players should be judged on their individual merits rather than a number. A number is a good indicator at a glance but rarely holds up to scrutiny.</p><p>Maybe SP should be considered not as an outright restriction, but only insofar as we should make sure we have a good amount of experienced players among the new?</p>

We can't have people running out of days (I saw one in scav town as well as tamer town 2), we have to get people to realize this is a community event and yes you have to work with the community to make it go smoothly, we have to get far more dedicated players to give this event a chance... 2-3 deaths by day 2 in some towns? WHY?</p><p>I would bother to watch videos and read more forum posts but that seems almost an exercise in futility due to pure volume... Could probably have gotten a lot more sample BS that has happened though.</p><p>In my eyes this is a horrid display of an event that was a blast last time.</p>

I still stand by my opinion that Leapfrog is intelligent and knows more than someone with his amount SP usually might!</p>

                <p>Clearly you jumped to conclusions if you think I claimed to know everything about the game. I never said this. I simply said I was competent enough to work with other people and use the resources available to me. I have no problem admitting when I don't fully understand something, yet I have 39 other people I can ask for help.</p><p>You went on tangents to me about being ignorant and "obviously stupid" for saying that. You continuously attacked me. All I ever said is that the game isn't so complicated that you need a year of playing to get a grasp on it with so many resources available to you. You only need to be devoted and willing to learn, read, and communicate. You took that to mean that I use the wiki as law and made assumptions yet again when I clearly never said that.</p><p>I don't understand how staying "I believe I'm competent enough to be in CotT2 and willing to learn by reading the resources available to me and through using communication. So I believe simply using SP as a way to weed out players is the wrong way to go about things." is 'posting rubbish'. You PMed me and started off with "You're the kind of person I'm hoping to weed out, are you really that stupid or are you just trying to troll?" So my thought out opinion is rubbish, yet your direct attack was intelligent, well meaning, and helpful?</p><p>Edit: I won't be responding to your posts after this, as I don't wish to turn this thread into a personal war.

                <p>Anyways, i believe that the conception of the Clash of Titans, is too get more players to became heroes. And in the moment you buy 30 days to became a heroe to play the clash, you can see the difference of playing alone being resident, and playing toghether being heroe.</p><p>So i guess put much out of the conception, when you insert a prerequiste that the players must be more then 200 heroe points.</p>

                <p>You insist on keeping this an argument, so I have no choice but to defend myself if you're going to try and publically make me out to be something I'm not. I never claimed that was your entire first post. Do you really want me to post the whole message? I was pointing out your first message was attacking me, and backing it up with proof. Yes, you started it off with "Don't want to derail the cott thread any further" But you ended it with</p><p>"You're taking ignorance to a level beyond what is typical with new players... are you really that stupid or are you just trolling?"</p><p>That's how you address me in your first message, having never personally spoken to me before. I never claimed to have an issue with restrictions, so I don't know where that came from. If it's clearly stated from the get go there are restrictions, that's fine. My issue was in changing restrictions well after sign-ups simply because a few 'veterans' request them (Which never happened anyways and ended up being a moot point).</p><p>As for you mis-quoting me about the wiki to prove a point. I believe I said "Just about anything you could need is right there" and also stated many times about *learning from other people* I never insulted you aside from saying you seem like a very entitled person. And when I tried to end the conversation you said:</p><p>"In other words, you've realised how stupid your claims are, and are finally shutting up.

                <p>Only problem with the idea of a competitive event with experienced players is that you can`t really make it public. Otherwise people who THINK they are experienced are gonna try to get in. Also, the difference between skilled and bad cant be really taken with the soul points.

                <p>BerceaMondialu suggested an SP cap and an invite system. I think that could work well, though the actual SP requirement and the picking of captains would be interesting things to decide.</p><p>Having said that, I wonder if CotT3 is the best title for this thread. MT have made 5 news posts about CotT2 so they are obviously pretty interested in it, no doubt because it has the potential to draw in lots of new heroes. I have a feeling they might not want the event taking this kind of turn, but they'd likely support a separate one.</p>

                <p>Regardless of points, <strong>Guardians</strong> will be the true winners.</p><p>I suppose of the other towns I'm rooting for techs because A) it's a great class with great players and it's nice to see them reaching their potential and B) they're not displaying Andrewmaniscool's "We win because we're nice!" attitude.</p><p>I mean, teamwork is a very important aspect of the Clash, true, and I applaud it. But it's not the only aspect. Try losing 3-4 people to 90% camping chances and several more to the unavoidable circumstances that nearly claimed Lilmarie and the guy with the hacksaw.</p><p>I'm not bitter about the Guardian town's bad luck - just the implication that everyone else is losing because they're too stupid to work together or something. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So that this is on topic, I will continue to maintain that while, as Wayson says, SP is the easiest descriminator, that doesn't make it the best. And again, aside from the occasional non-hero getting in off MT's badly-timed free days, I haven't seen any problems in this Clash that are the result of inexperience.</p><p>If there are newer players that refuse to listen, as it <em>sounds</em> may have been the case in Tamers 2, blame their attitudes rather than their SP.</p>

That "argument" is actually a fallacy and doesn't prove anything. New players are all around this game, they have been in many events (including the first CotT) and they didn't cause any problem.
