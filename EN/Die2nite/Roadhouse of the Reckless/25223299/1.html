                <p>So I had a random bout of insomnia the other day, and decided to write a short story for the town telling a story from a rather different perspective, and it turned into a story of how the zombie plague came to be. A couple of my fellow townies told me to post it into the world forums, and since this thread is here it seemed like a good place to do it. I hope you enjoy. (I posted it in a thread in the resident's forum thinking it was a thread for just posting stories, so if you read it there, then you should know there is nothing new here. <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_lol.gif" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">)</p><p>The Confession -</p><p>There is something that no one ever seems to think about as the world is ending. What happens afterwards? Now this is a pretty understandable mistake to make, as the whole concept of ending usually implies that there will not be anything afterwards. And yet, there is. Is it hell? Did the end of the world actually kill us all and now we have wound up in a hell not full of pitchfork wielding demons, but shambling hordes of brain eating zombies?<br>I know the truth, however. I know what caused it.<br>It was me.<br>Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Dr. Albert Curie Tesla Smith. No, the name isn’t a joke, my parents decided that I would be a scientist even before I was born, and they decided that simply being Dr. Smith wouldn’t be sufficiently ‘sciency’ for lack of a better word. So they decided to name me after 3 of history’s greatest minds. And then they forced me into the mold they had chosen for me. And I was a good boy. I did what my parents told me.<br>My doctorate is technically in Nanomechanical Bio-Engineering. Which means I built little tiny… well, you can call them machines, but the word breaks down when you get into things that small. Is it a machine if it is really just a string of proteins and RNA inside a cellular wall? We did have a different word for them once.<br>We called them Viruses.<br>And I built one, piece by meticulous piece. I built one to order. I designed it to heal. It would do everything that our own bodies couldn’t do, and do it on the cellular level. It would find wounds, and heal them by constructing individual cells and linking them together in a latticework, just as our own bodies do, only thousands of times faster. And I solved the issue of making them figure out how to do all this, by networking them all together. One, or one hundred, or even a hundred thousand was pretty much useless. But a billion? 10 billion? 100 billion? They could follow simple programs.<br>Ahh, hubris. I thought I could make humanity immortal with my machines. We would live forever. The virus did what it was programmed to do, and it made sure that we didn’t die. We couldn’t. The virus would prevent that from happening. But I made my mistakes. It wasn’t ready to be used, I did understand that, I am a scientist after all. I knew that the virus was not ready for human testing, though I had high hopes. It worked in a small scale test in laboratories, on rats, but that was a long way from human testing. But I forgot about two ‘little’ things. The purpose of all viruses is to reproduce, and I had used a virus as the core of my ‘machine’. So it reproduced. The second thing is that a rat that is pissed off from poking and prodding will bite, and rat teeth are really good at chewing through things. And so it bit me, and I made my third mistake. I swore, cleaned out the wound, and went home.<br>My virus operated at a greatly accelerated rate. It used up the resources in a human body very quickly, building cells, repairing damage. The human body is a complex machine after all. And it needs a lot of resources. That first day it spread through my body rapidy, using my own body’s resources to reproduce itself, causing horrific damage to me on a cellular level in the process, though that took the better part of a day to occur. So when I washed out my bite at home I didn’t know that anything was wrong, though I felt a little under the weather. The virus did what viruses do, however, and it spread into the water supply, and then of course inexorably the virus spread into the food chain, quickly breaking down anything it came into contact with, and then doing what it was programmed to do. Build a human body. From the ground up.<br>Do you know how much of the human body is water? How much is used up when you build a human out of raw materials? That is what most of those poor wretches are out there, human bodies created virtually from nothing by a virus doing what it is programmed to do. Only there is one problem. The human mind takes time to develop. Years to reach the point where it is really capable of anything that could remotely be conceived of as thought, and that is only if the brain is taught. The virus, however, is not a loving parent. All it can do is keep the poor wretch stumbling around, constantly hungry, looking for food, as any baby would be, and since most of the food has been eaten already, well actually dissolved into component parts would be a better term, the only readily available source any more is humanity. Because the virus can’t think, you see. It can’t reason that the person its host is eating is a human being that it should be protecting; it is simply a source of food. But within a few bites, the virus settles into the new host, and then it starts to breed when it discovers something that its programming recognizes.<br>At this point you might be thinking, well, why is that so bad? Admittedly the poor wretches that were created virtually from nothing had no minds to speak of, but what about a thinking human being? We already have minds. And the virus is designed to make us immortal. Why would that be so bad? And the simple fact of the matter is that when the virus spreads throughout the entire body it gains enough processing power to override the nerve impulses in the synapses of a human body. And then you get to the true horror of it all. You see, I specifically designed this version of the virus to leave the brain alone. I am no neural scientist. I intended to work with an expert later on to work on a way to help victims of brain trauma, but I hadn’t gotten that far yet. I was still in the preliminary stages after all. So the virus can’t modify the brain, though it seems to do a decent job of building a basic one. But it can control the body readily enough. Control it enough to search out more sources of food, and more ways to breed.<br>The remaining uninfected humans have discovered that pouring water onto one of the infected dissolves the body. They think that it is a good way to kill the infected, but they are wrong. What they are seeing isn’t destruction, but actually growth. The water gives the virus more raw materials to work with. Yes, the body will break down immediately, but the next day there will be more growing up in its place, once again created from raw materials, using the extra water that it needed. The poor remaining uninfected humans think they have the perfect weapon, but all they are doing is speeding up their own destruction.</p>

                <p>My body lurches forwards as the virus uses its poor control over my muscles to force me towards the walled fort. I can feel the others around me now, some kind of weird gestalt mind that is created when this many infected are around. We tend to move as one, in a swarm, like a cloud of gnats or a school of fish. I wonder how many of them are intelligent, people become prisoners in their own bodies like me, and how many of them are blank slates, created from nothing like horribly twisted caricatures of the mythic Titans.<br>We lurch towards the building, and begin slamming our fists into the walls. Eventually we will batter them down. We always do. A few brave souls stand out on the walls, attacking with makeshift weapons, not knowing that the wounds they inflict will be healed again by morning. A few throw some precious water bombs out into the horde, and I see a few infected dissolve down to components cells which sink into the ground as the virus strives to gather all the precious water, and find enough other raw materials to be able to create 2 infected bodies where there was once only one.<br>My fists pound on the walls and I pray that this time, finally, one of those water bombs will find me, and I will dissolve into unthinking, unfeeling goo, and my pitiful hellish existence will finally be over. Perhaps I have finally paid enough for my sins.<br>A small crack is developing in the wall in front of me. I hear arguing and bickering from inside. This small walled town is not ready for us, and the recriminations fly. I can hear people blaming one another. The crack in the wall widens slightly. Already it is at the point where if I were in control of my body I could simply slip my hands into the crack and rip it open. But the virus cannot reason that well. All it can do is pound on the wall, but that will be enough. Eventually. The horde cannot ever truly be stopped.<br>The sun comes up, and the town is still standing. The sun begins to beat down, and the horde retreats. I am not sure how it happened, but the horde has learned that the sunlight will eventually desiccate a body to the point where the virus is forced to go dormant, and so when the sun comes up we retreat to bury ourselves in the sand, or to hide in old ruined buildings, or any other place where we can escape the heat. A few remain active, again part of the primitive collective intellect of the virus having learned the uninfected will be out to search for useful supplies during the day. Today I am one of the ones that has buried themselves.<br>Hours pass, and I hear someone moving overhead, but the hive mind does not allow me to react. I can hear digging and scrabbling as the survivor looks for anything in the vicinity that they could use. I can also feel several of the infected lurching around on the surface, trying to fulfill their programming and spread to a new host. It sounds as though the survivor up there is able to keep away from them, however. Every now and then I can hear a loud thud, probably the survivor pushing over the infected on the surface in order to buy some more time to get away. I hope they succeed. The sounds of digging and movement stop after a while, and I think the survivor has moved on. I would breathe a sigh of relief if I could, but I am not in control of my body enough to even do that, and it is not as if I breathe any more anyway. Somehow the virus appears to be turning my body into a fully anaerobic machine. I try to work out how and why it is doing that, and the musing allows me to keep what is left of my sanity for another day.<br>Eventually I dig myself free of the sand, emerging into the night once again. Around me I see the rest of the horde clawing their way up out of the sand, in a horrific parody of birth, and as one we turn and lurch towards the town again. I hear screams and shouts, ahead. The gates have been shut, but there is still someone outside. There is also someone hanging over the wall on some kind of makeshift gibbet. The survivors are stupid. If they had tacked the body down somewhere outside they could have distracted some of the horde from the attack. The survivor that is outside keeps pounding on the door, screaming, but no one lets him in. The first of the horde reaches him. I wish I could look away, but I am still moving that direction. I wish I could shut out the screams of someone being eaten alive, but I can’t. At least this time I am not close enough to reach the body in time to take a bite.<br>The remaining parts of the victim are already beginning to heal as the virus spreads through what is left of the infected tissues. This one reached the threshold of infection very quickly, perhaps due to the large number of bites he received at one time, so his body was mostly intact. Luckily for this one, although he was eaten alive his brain was not left intact enough for him to be sentient when he gets back up again, so at least he will be spared that. The rest of the horde moves past the body, and begins pounding on the walls again. The cracks spread more rapidly than they did the day before. There is evidence of repair work, and now the walls have been studded with bits of razor wire and other assorted old chunks of metal. I watch as my flesh is shredded down to the bone time and time again, thankful that the blocks to my synapses also prevent me from feeling the pain. Again I hear the recriminations and threats being yelled back and forth inside. There are fewer guards up on the walls tonight too, perhaps the one left outside or the one who was hung had been amongst the brave ones fighting yesterday. Towards the dawn we have almost broken down the wall, but once again the town is saved by the dawn.<br>My body turns and I stumble away. Today I am mobile, staying out of the sand, looking for survivors. I tend to stay more in the shade, but I can feel my body stiffening up as some of the precious water evaporates from my body in some twisted parody of sweating. It is not long before a survivor from the town comes out looking for things to scavenge. This one is a woman, and she clutches a Super Soaker water gun slung from a strap on her shoulder. I lurch towards her, seeing my hands reach out towards her. Around me I feel the other infected that are in the immediate area doing the same. She looks at me, and I see the calculation pass though her eyes. She knocks me down with a quick kick to my knee. I fall over, unable to dodge even a simple kick. As my body begins to laboriously get to its feet I see her shoot a gout of water at a nearby infected. I want to shout “NO, SHOOT ME!” at her, but of course I can’t. That infected dissolves quickly, and she runs past the puddle of goo, shooting another as she runs. That one dissolves too. Then she is out of sight, over a hill. Unseen by her, the other infected in the area move towards puddles of goo trying to collect enough water for themselves out of the remains to be able to dissolve themselves. I finally manage to get to my feet and lurch in that direction as I see another of the infected in the area is apparently able to extract enough water to begin the dissolution process itself. Of course, by the time I get there, there is nothing left but a slight stain on the sand. At that point my mind finally snaps, and I give up trying to hold onto my sanity. I am cursed. I will be trapped in this hellish existence forever, as punishment for my crimes.<br>I do not know how much time I lose, but when I come too again I am standing in the wreckage of the town. No one is left except for infected, and as one the horde turns and moves off to the north. Somehow we know that there are surviving uninfected in that direction.<br>There won’t be for long.</p>
