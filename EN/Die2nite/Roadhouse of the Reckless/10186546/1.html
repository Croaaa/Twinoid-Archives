                <cite>How many seasons have you played?</cite><br>This is my fourth; I joined about a month or so into season 1.<br><br><br><cite>What is your preferred profession?</cite><br>Last season I'd have said Scav or Tamer; now it's gotta be Survivalist all the way. I mean, free f**kin' water every day, come <em>on</em>!<br><br><br><cite>What external apps do you use?</cite><br>FF plugin, Oval Office, Dusk Till Dawn, Rulesy's map. And of course .net and IRC. Big fan of The Herald, too. My huge respect and admiration goes to all the creators of the 3rd party apps and sites. <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_smile.gif"><br><br><br><cite>What is your gender?</cite><br>Male...let me just check... yeah. Male.<br><br><br><cite>What is your age range? </cite><br>30-40<br><br><br><cite>How long have you been a hero?</cite><br>Since 2 days after I joined d2n.<br><br><br><cite>What made you become a hero?</cite><br>The ability to post on the world forum and answer SOOPA AWSUM SURVEYS. That and all the cool extra stuff you can do, plus it's really quite reasonably priced for an online game, all things considered.<br><br><br><cite>What is your town preference? Distant, Hardcore, Small Map</cite><br>Distant. That said, I've only played one HC town, which was hilarious from beginning to end, but that was more to do with the people than the hardcore side of things. Small maps just don't rock my world, I'm afraid.<br><br><br><cite>Are you in a Meta, Coalition or do you play solo?</cite><br>Coalition of 5, part of the Live2Morrow meta.  Sometimes people get funny about others mentioning which coalitions they're in, so I won't name my coal mates; but I will say that they are, to a man, <em>awesome.</em> Put it this way: between the 5 of us we total 10994 SP. Oh yeah.<br><br><br><cite>Do you consider yourself a leader or follower?</cite><br>Depends on the town really. I'd say more often a leader, but on the occasions where I've been in towns with bona fide d2n aristocracy like Fodgy or Workshop, I've found it better to shut up and listen. <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_smile.gif"><br><br><br><cite>What would make you more active on the forums?</cite><br>I'm very active in town forums, and reasonably so on the WF. I'm pretty happy with that; I do need <em>some</em> time with my family.<br><br><br><cite>What kind of community events have you participated in?</cite><br>All the MMJs, the Clash and the Season 4 Scav Hunt. And again, the .net forums and IRC.<br><br><br><cite>If you have not participated in any community events, why not?</cite><br>N/A<br><br><br><cite>Do you see D2N as a game or a social outlet or both?</cite><br>Oh, both definitely.  I'd even say that it's inherent in the game, as use of the town forum is critical to success, and the WFs function on peer assistance.<br>There's a definite "core community" here (as one would expect from a browser based game with a generally high player turnover) - but it presents a very warm and welcoming front, and (I hope) never feels cliquey or arrogant.  I think the people that really "get" this game and stick around for a long time are the ones that embrace the co-operative element of it.<br><br><br><cite>Did your love of zombies draw you to this game or is it just another game you found to play?</cite><br>I actually heard about it from a friend of mine, who posted a long and enthusiastic rant about it which piqued my curiosity. It probably helped that I'd recently finished reading "World War Z" at the time, too.<br><br><br><cite>How long do you plan to continue playing this game?</cite><br>Until the zombie apocalypse comes. And I'll be <em>ready</em> for it.

                <strong>How Many Seasons Have you played?</strong> <br>Since beta, well actually a few days after beta ended. I know this because I asked Epoq specifically when I started. <br><br><strong>What is your preferred profession? </strong> <br>I prefer Survivalist. At heart I am a Tamer. <br><br><strong>What External apps do you use?</strong> <br>Every one of them!<br><br><strong>What is your Gender? </strong><br>Female<br><br><strong>What is your age range? </strong><br>I am now ageless. <br><br><strong>How long have you been a hero?</strong><br>I can't remember. Most likely one of the first few towns I played.<br><br><br><strong>What made you become a hero?</strong> <br>Just like every game I play...if I enjoy it I will pay for the perks.<br><br><strong>What is your town preference?</strong><br>Distant towns! But I like playing all of them. <br><br><strong>Are you in a Meta, Coalition or do you play solo?</strong><br>I am in a coalition with Loyalty, Willis, Blight and Chaz1840. And they say they "can't talk very much because Deblyn won't shut up". I have no idea what they mean <br><br><strong>Do you consider yourself a leader or follower? </strong> <br>Although I play ALL the time....I rely on others for game mechanics. <br><br><strong>What would make you more active on the forums?</strong> <br>LOL....as Kiwi stated "if I was any more active I might get banned for spam"<br><br><strong>What kind of community events have you participated in?</strong> <br>If I don't take part in a particular community event I still try to be verbally supportive. The talent here is amazing! <br><br><strong>If you have not participated in any community events, why not?</strong><br>I am horrid at the graphic art parts...and I am envious of people that can do it well. On the other hand, it makes me want to try. <br><br><strong>Do you see D2N as a game or a social outlet or both?</strong><br>Both!! I have great fun. I do a lot of work from home. And because I am scoring sleep <em>epochs</em> on the studies...it of course reminds me of d2n. And I pop into say a few words. ♥<br><br><strong>Did your love of zombies draw you to this game or is it just another game you found to play?</strong><br>I have a favored game partner that leads me to a lot of strange games. He brought me here. <br><br><strong>How long do you plan to continue playing this game?</strong><br>I feel vested in the game and with the people here. I may take small breaks but I like the community.

But i like to take long breaks, so iv'e had my hero days for over a year.<br><br><strong>What made you become a hero?</strong><br>The perks/benefits. Also being able to play as a Guardian was to great to pass up.<br><br><strong>What is your town preference? Distant, Hardcore, Small Map</strong><br>Though iv'e only played a few, hardcore maps are extremely fun.<br><br><strong>Are you in a Meta, Coalition or do you play solo?</strong><br>Solo. Though it's fun to play with people you know, it's also fun to meet completely new people as well.<br><br><strong>Do you consider yourself a leader or follower?</strong><br>Follower. Leader position just isn't my thing (Not like i'm a great follower either though).<br><br><strong>What would make you more active on the forums? </strong><br>Nothing really. Forums are Forums. It's hard to make them different.<br><br><strong>What kind of community events have you participated in? </strong><br>Clash of the Titans. I've also recently been entering the forum competitions (T-shirt contest, new avatar for the crow, etc).<br><br><strong>Do you see D2N as a game or a social outlet or both?</strong><br>A game. But games SHOULD have some sort of sociability, so somewhat both. <br><br><strong>Did your love of zombies draw you to this game or is it just another game you found to play?</strong><br>Kind of. My love of games drew me in, zombies were the sweet cherry on top.<br><br><strong>How long do you plan to continue playing this game?</strong><br>Until i get bored. But even when that happens, i just kinda take a break then reappear again later.

                Well it has been a while since I've answered any of the questionnaires, so I guess it's time to toss in my two cents worth again and let people know that my <big>Imaginary Friends</big> and I are still alive and trying to keep it that way.<br><br><em>How Many Seasons Have you played?</em> In With the bricks and continuous since then.<br><em>What is your preferred profession?</em> Being the #1 ranked <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_guard.gif"> in the <strong>Oval Office</strong> kinda gives that away, doesn't it?<br><em>What External apps do you use?</em> <strong>Oval Office, From Dusk Till Dawn, External Map, Map Viewer <em>welcome back Rulesy</em>, and Atlas all with the Updaters.</strong> Wish I had more time to spend in the <strong>Herald, Steam Group</strong> and that <em><big>.net</big></em> site that has been a lifesaver to so many, but I do manage to wander in every now and then.<br><br><em>What is your Gender?</em> (optional) Masculine on most days. None on those other occasions.<br><em>What is your age range?</em> (optional)<br>14-19 higher<br>20-30 higher<br>30-40 higher<br>40+ I guess a couple <strong>+'s</strong> will cover it, just glad your not asking what age I feel<br><br><em>How long have you been a hero?</em> 375 days, but who's counting?<br><em>What made you become a hero?</em> Started out I just wanted to throw some money at the devs for the great job they have done but now I can't live without the additional advantages and perks.<br><br><em>What is your town preference? Distant, Hardcore, Small Map</em> All with the exception that the small maps seem so small after playing in the others.<br><em>Are you in a Meta, Coalition or do you play solo?</em> I have a coalition and try to occasionally organize the <strong>ZOA Meta</strong> jumps.<br><em>Do you consider yourself a leader or follower?</em> Sort of in the middle, I'm more inclined to follow but sometimes people seem to follow me, thrusting me into a quasi leadership/organizer role.<br><br><em>What would make you more active on the forums?</em> More time availability and <big>Better Typing Skills</big>.<br><em>What kind of community events have you participated in?</em> As many as I have been able to get into. Most recently the <strong><em>Clash</em></strong> and <strong><em>Scavenger Hunt</em></strong> (Still ongoing).<br><em>If you have not participated in any community events, why not?</em> <big>Answer negated by the above response.</big><br><em>Do you see D2N as a game or a social outlet or both?</em> Which category does <em><big>A Way Of Life</big></em>  fall under?<br><br><em>Did your love of zombies draw you to this game or is it just another game you found to play?</em> Love of Zombies? Game? I'm getting confused. The only good Zombie us a dead Zombie!! <em>(I guess by that definition they are all good?)</em> <strong>I Hate Zombies</strong>, but really it was quite by accident I found this place and was happy to find some serious people who's company I have enjoyed.<br><br><em>How long do you plan to continue playing this game?</em> Until everyone of those <big>Undead Scum</big> are <strong>Destroyed</strong>, <strong>Dismembered</strong> and <strong>Put In Their Proper Place</strong> and my Imaginary Friends are safe once again to Plot the Destruction of Civilization as we know it. Or at least their continued Plots against me.<br><br>Does this answer your questions?

I was always there, but you guys didn't notice, because I was super awesome ninja-like.<br><br><strong>What is your preferred profession? </strong><br>HOW DARE YOU NOT INCLUDE RESIDENT!!<img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_rage.gif"><br>Feel my wrath NyxOwl! I am gonna be spanking you good. <strong><em>RESIDENT FOR PRESIDENT!!</em></strong><br><br><strong>What External apps do you use?</strong><br>All of them. That's how awesome I am, but yeah, FDTD and Oval Office got some of my extra love.</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><strong>What is your Gender?</strong><br>Officially, I am a male, but everyone sees me as neither male or female. They see me as a god. Dunno why. Probably my awesomeness.<br><br><strong>What is your age range?</strong><br>14-19... yeah, I know, it's quite worrying for me. I mean, if my awesomeness is like that in that age range, how much will it grow when I turn 40+? Always, when I try to imagine that, I see myself above Chuck Norri.............s. Phew, huff, that guy is pretty strong, still not match for Juice though.</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><strong>How long have you been a hero?</strong><br>Technically, 56 Days, but seriously... this question is dumb. <br><strong><em>I AM ALWAYS A HERO TO THE PEOPLE!</em></strong><br><br><strong>What made you become a hero?</strong><br>You mean "who" made me a hero. I won't name names, because of certain reasons. I had 80 free hero days. I seriously dunno, why you guys see this as a gift. IT'S A <strong><em>DAMN CURSE</em></strong>, I say! When I was a resident, I was already awesome enough, but now as a hero, it's too much. People cannot comprehend it. My awesomeness is overflowing and flooding them. Guys, if something awesome happens or when feel like you are awesome, you know who the cause is. Yeah, it's me. I know it sounds like a good thing, but it's not! There's a thing called... the BALANCE IN THE UNIVERSE. Luckily, I will be very soon a resident again!</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><strong>What is your town preference? Distant, Hardcore, Small Map</strong><br>I play Private towns mostly... oops, was that a secret? Anyway, when I am not playing privately, I usually switch between these types of towns and gift players with some of my awesomeness. I prefer Distant towns though(excluding Private), as my "hero days" are very soon to be over. Alternatively, small towns.<br><br>Actually, the above is just one awesome joke. I play <strong><em>ALL THE TOWNS!</em></strong> You might not see me, but I am there! That's how awesome ninja-like I am.<br><br><strong>Are you in a Meta, Coalition or do you play solo?</strong><br>Well, this Season I joined my first and only meta, since I need to store my awesomeness somewhere. But I kinda prefer playing only with my coalition though, since I am kinda the awesome guy, who shares his awesomeness with other unknown people. My coalition mates, err... no, actually, my biggest fans and greatest disciples are helping me in my awesome journey. Sometimes, I play even solo though. It's nice to take a breather from my pesky fans.<br><br><strong>Do you consider yourself a leader or follower?</strong><br>In all seriousness, I am actually a leader type, but when I lead towns, it's very exhausting to hold back my awesomeness. If I wasn't permanently holding it back, then I would definitely land first in these so-called rankings. Especially in my meta towns I need to control myself, since they would probably all work themselves to this so-called heaven.<br></span><span class="tid_roleplay"><strong>What would make you more active on the forums?</strong><br>I am pretty much active already, if you know what I mean. I am very busy with holding back my awesomeness, SO GIVE ME A BREAK NYXOWL. Even I need some rest. Hmph... Anyway, since I will have soon only 2 "hero days" left, I will be pretty much in the unknown again, be A LEGEND, I mean.<br><br><strong>What kind of community events have you participated in?</strong><br>Officially or unofficially? Unofficially I have participated in everything. Officially, I have participated in the Captions Contest, the Zombie Runway Contest, the Artwork Contest, the Design a T-Shirt Contest, the Avatar for The Crow Contest and the Photoshop your town Contest. I hosted the Sing UP Contest and I am currently participating in the Scavenger Hunt Contest and the What would you do for 100 Hero Days Contest. Yep, that's it.<br><br><strong>If you have not participated in any community events, why not?</strong><br>I have answered your above question, so I don't see the point of this one.<br>NyxOwl... you definitely need some of my awesomeness... after the punishment I will be giving you, of course.<br><br><strong>Do you see D2N as a game or a social outlet or both?</strong><br>D2N? Game? Social Outlet? The real post-apocalypse zombie world is calling you. I know, that you are probably shocked and most people are too, but unfortunately this is not a game or a dream. This is the real world. <strong><em>ZOMBIES ARE REAL!</em></strong></span><span class="tid_roleplay"><strong>Did your love of zombies draw you to this game or is it just another game you found to play?</strong><br>Seriously... again? Okay, for your sake I will play "your game" for this time. So let's see... I found this game through a friend. It's a funny and awesome story, I tell. You wanna hear it? On a lovely day of awesomeness, when I was still young, I had an "IT" friend. I used my <strong><em>Tamer</em></strong> powers to sniff him out and there he was, playing on his computer. Since I always saw him on his computer, I was kinda curious, what he was doing all the time. Like a <strong><em>Survivalist</em></strong> a found some food and putted it in a place very far away from his computer to lure him out. Once he sniffed that lovely juicy food, he stood up and went to get it. I used this chance to <strong><em>Scout</em></strong> my way successfully to his computer. I found out ,that that damn bastardo passworded his account before he left. There was no other way, I had to release my awesomeness. Like a <strong><em>Technician</em></strong> I hacked my way into his browser, at the same time closely watching that bastardo like a <strong><em>Guardian</em></strong>. It was a close call, but I managed to crack his password. After that I had not much time to look, but my <strong><em>Scavenger</em></strong> powers helped me to find out the answer I was looking for. There it was. Die2Nite. Curiously I quickly read, what it was about and found it quite interesting. I registered and my <strong><em>Resident</em></strong> journey of awesomeness began.</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><strong>How long do you plan to continue playing this game?</strong><br>When I am done with my goals. So 100x Community Awards and the title "Juiced" or "Awesome Juice" or "Juicesome", something awesome.</span>

                <strong>How Many Seasons Have you played?</strong><br><br>Since Season 1, all of them.<br><br><strong>What is your preferred profession?</strong><br><br>Tough to say. Scavenger or Tamer probably. I'd like to get into Scout more, but haven't had too many opportunities yet.<br><br><strong>What External apps do you use?</strong><br><br>Pretty much all of them. Mostly D2D.<br><br><strong>What is your Gender? (optional)</strong><br><br>27.<br><br><strong>What is your age range? (optional)</strong><br><br>N/A<br><br><strong>How long have you been a hero?</strong><br><br>Since not too long after I started playing. I ran out and didn't renew in protest after the meta cap was instituted in Season 3, but when Season 4 launched I bought 6 months the same day.<br><br><strong>What made you become a hero?</strong><br><br>Heroic Abilities, mainly, but the specific triggering reason at the time was being able to choose a specific town so that I and my coalition could participate in meta jumps. <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_smile.gif"><br><br><strong>What is your town preference? Distant, Hardcore, Small Map</strong><br><br>Distant, probably. Hardcore I find to be more annoying than difficult, so Distant towns are my preference.<br><br><strong>Are you in a Meta, Coalition or do you play solo?</strong><br><br>I am a member of <em>Wonderful Failure</em>.<br><br><strong>Do you consider yourself a leader or follower?</strong><br><br>Depends on my ability to commit to the game. In general, I tend to take charge when I don't see someone willing to do so themselves. When I do take responsibility for planning, etc., I often spend a lot of time on it to make sure it gets done right (or as right as possible). This isn't always compatible with what I have going on in real life. <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_lol.gif"><br><br><strong>What would make you more active on the forums?</strong><br><br>Unsure of context here. The World Forums, I assume? I don’t know how to answer this either – I pretty much participate whenever I see something I find interesting.<br><br><strong>What kind of community events have you participated in?</strong><br><br>Let’s see… I think the first real community events I participated in were the Mega Meta Jumps. Really exciting for the time too. I’ve also participated in the Clash of the Titans, and I’d like to participate in the upcoming Battle of the Sex(i)es, MadWilly’s “suicide cult” town (drink the Kool-Aid!), and look forward to future ones too!<br><br><strong>If you have not participated in any community events, why not?</strong><br><br>N/A<br><br><strong>Do you see D2N as a game or a social outlet or both?</strong><br><br>Definitely both. I don’t think the social aspect would be nearly as strong without such a strong IRC community presence to tie the in-game stuff to the out-of-game, more personal, connections.<br><br><strong>Did your love of zombies draw you to this game or is it just another game you found to play?</strong><br><br>Definitely the zombies. <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_lol.gif"> I was looking for some free zombie-themed games to play in a browser one day when I was bored. Die2Nite hooked me pretty much from the get-go.<br><br><strong>How long do you plan to continue playing this game?</strong><br><br>Not really sure, honestly. If it’s not too much of a cop-out answer, I’d have to say ‘as long as I’m still having fun.’ There are definitely friendships and personal connections I’ve made that are strong enough to be independent of the game, at least for a while. I don’t think I’d ever stop dropping by IRC to chat, at least not for a while, even if I did quit playing the game at some point.

                <p><strong>How Many Seasons Have you played?</strong></p><p>Ages ago under a different account I played across three seasons. On this account I've played in two, so that's five total</p><p><strong>What is your preferred profession?</strong></p><p>Survivalist.</p><p><strong>What External apps do you use? </strong></p><p>FDTD all the time. Occasionally I use the camping calculator spreadsheet. Oh, and if the wiki counts I use that a fair bit.</p><p><strong>What is your Gender?</strong></p><p>Male. Have you ever met a woman named Larry?</p><p><strong>What is your age range?</strong></p><p>Somewhere between 39 years 1 month and 39 years 11 months.</p><p><strong>How long have you been a hero?</strong></p><p>Well, long enough to unlock False Bottom and get about halfway towards unlocking Lucky Find.</p><p><strong>What made you become a hero?</strong></p><p>I won LMS for 5 or 6 days and it was so cool I had to buy more.<br> <br><strong>What is your town preference? Distant, Hardcore, Small Map</strong></p><p>Distant.</p><p><strong>Are you in a Meta, Coalition or do you play solo?</strong></p><p>Jumping into a random town with my coalition is my favorite way to play. Recently we've played a couple towns with a meta and will continue to do so, but I'll need the odd random town. I only play solo when I've died early in a town and think I can finish a small map random in time to join my coalition for the next town.</p><p><strong>Do you consider yourself a leader or follower?</strong></p><p>In towns I tend to follow, because others have much more experience and can make better plans. I've got some great planners in my coalition, so I generally defer to their judgment even though I'm technically the leader.</p><p><strong>What would make you more active on the forums?</strong></p><p>More free time irl.</p><p><strong>What kind of community events have you participated in?</strong></p><p>Unless this survey counts, none.</p><p><strong>If you have not participated in any community events, why not?</strong></p><p>I some times question the time I put into the game alone, let alone anything else in the way of community events.</p><p><strong>Do you see D2N as a game or a social outlet or both?</strong></p><p>Both, but mostly a game.</p><p><strong>Did your love of zombies draw you to this game or is it just another game you found to play?</strong></p><p>I love the zombie genre, but no one gets it right, not in movies or TV or games. The survival aspect is what's fascinating, not the gore and violence. How do people meet their basic needs and protect against the zombies at the same time? More importantly, how to people protect against each other? What rings true-to-life and makes the zombie genre truly interesting, is that the survivors ultimately prove more a threat to each other than the zombies were. (This is a huge part of what makes Romero's early zombie films, Night and Dawn, so gripping. It's also why 28 Days Later is pretty good.)</p><p>This is played out beautifully in D2N. Cooperation is the best way to ensure the longest survival for the most people. But invariably, sooner or later, the desire to survive produces selfishness. That's why I love random towns; the organization and selflessness in a meta doesn't reflect and develop the the game's heart, which is a psycho-social dynamic similar to the tragedy of the commons or the prisoner's dilemma.</p><br><p><strong>How long do you plan to continue playing this game?</strong></p><p>Probably as long as it's here.</p>
