                <p>It's no secret that the game isn't in its heyday. Gameplay is as good as ever, but it's so hard to throw a town together because so few people are playing.</p><p>I created this forum to discuss ideas for how to increase the number of players and make the game more playable with the given number of players. Let me know your ideas down below!</p><p>1) Smaller town option<br> Half the people who join just die of thirst on day 4 anyway. Presumably, they gave up waiting for the game to start or forgot about it while waiting. So starting the game with 30 or even 20 survivors would be of benefit because if they don't have to wait so long to play, they won't forget to play for three days in a row. For mini towns, you may have to adjust gameplay somehow, perhaps give more max AP, reduce horde size, and/or shrink the map, but it's doable.</p><p>2) Promote in Zombieland's Wake.<br> Zombieland will bring zombies closer to the front of the cultural zeitgeist. What if, when anticipation is at its peak, we intentionally started talking about D2N more on social media? We could pick a specific, arbitrary day (like Halloween, since zombies are spooky and Zombieland 2 will have been out for 2 weeks). Leading up to that day, we could go on social media and say "This Halloween, Die 2 Nite player usage will SKYROCKET!" That may pull in some people who are tired of waiting an eternity to start their town, and also new players as well. A good segue into...</p><p>3)Focus on drawing in newer players<br> There are 2 kinds of people who aren't playing D2N: Those who used to and those who never have before. If the ones who used to wanted to play, they'd play. Whether they played as kids but now have jobs, or they just don't like it anymore doesn't matter.<br>Newer players, on the other hand, probably haven't ever even heard of or seen an ad for Die2Nite in their lives. Many would play if they heard of it, so they ought to be our target audience, I think.</p><p>Any other ideas? I'm gonna post a similar forum thread on Reddit and try to update each thread with the comments of the other. We gotta put our heads together.</p>

                <p>Okay, the issue of Small Maps having early deaths is happening ever since we got the Big Maps for players with 100 Soul Points (something you probably have no clue what it is).</p><p>Even before that each town had a handful of first-comers that joined the towns and decided the game wasn't something that they would invest their time in and then they vanish for good, resulting in the Dehy deaths on day 4.</p><p>But yeah, the bulk of die2nite players are now in towns wit bigger maps. They are much better than the early deaths you see at Small Maps.</p><p>Those early deaths aren't the issue of die2nite though. Sure it could have been designed differently, but you have to understand that those suggestions you do at 1) require remodeling of the code, which sadly isn't possible as this game was abandoned by Motion Twin a long time ago.</p><p>2) and 3) are being done by community members through event themed towns (Right now there are 4 active towns that are doing very great, on day 18 already).</p><p>An old player made a post in facebook and got many old players back to it. If you check the Residents Forum you'll see lots of posts about it.</p><p>We can't do much to attract new players other than making a call on socia medias. Other than that, for old veterans playing on Small Maps, can be a bit mmmm claustrophobic at least. Not many of them are patient enough to teach and baby sitter the new players either.</p><p>Sadly for me the experience of the Small Maps is kind of a filter. Only those that are really interested in the game survive to see the big maps and eventually joining a meta group that will test the game limits to the maximum.</p><p>This game has a steep learning curve; even I don't know everything about it and I'm here since the beginning ish. If someone gave up, he/she is not worth of Dieing2nite in my opinion. You have to be patient and constant if you want to do great things in this game. This is true for both playing with friends and cooperatively and if you play selfishly.</p>

                <p>It might be beneficial to make a slightly updated ad, im a new player and the only reason I joined is A. Zombies, and B. online community. Maybe there can be an event where multiple towns are able to make a collab where it can benefit all the players? So making a youtube video for that would be pretty easyish. And then if us as players share the link you can offer something for the event like an extra water ration or something. Its just right now the town i am in has 18 residents, and well i only can move 3 spaces (since i want to make it back to the town). Im pretty sure we are in different time zones, but there is not much interaction between all of us.</p>

                <p>Again, there is no more developing for Die2nite. The owners of this game just kept it running and we should play it as it is.</p><p>All game interaction are made through Forums. If you want better coordination with your town mates you can set up Discord/IRC chats.</p><p>This game is not an action game. Think about spending your APs more carefully if you are the type of player that goes out of town to scavenge.</p><p>Seriously guys, play the game more before thinking on new "oh so awesome" ideas to improve it. If the way die2nite is bothers you then I'm sorry, but this game isn't for you.</p>
