Also, the term accurate can mean like gun shooting accuracy, or it can mean the accuracy stats in games like pokemon, or it can simply mean that something is just completely perfect and without flaws.</p><p>Data can refer to online data, offline data, personal data, shared data, network data, memory data and more.</p><p>If your saying that my data should be correct in details, does my username have to be correct in details?

I'd be interested to hear an official response though.</p><br><p>Mass trolling, mass griefing but I think mainly, D2N in particular operates on a season to season leaderboard which people compete to top. The idea for die2nite is to co-operate (or work against) 39 other players (whether they're random or organised) allowing multi-accounts would ruin this concept and the validity of the leaderboards.</p></cite><p>As if this concept and the validity of the leaderboards hasn't already been ruined due to past grifers like Gatekeeper777. Believe it or not, I was seriously against this whole trolling and grifing thing, and I, along with many others, have tried their best to keep the validity of leaderboards intact.<br>It was because the rule regarding naming and shaming was a dumb rule that should not have been put into effect at all.</p><p>Famous people like Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are "named and shamed" all the time, so what makes a grifer like Gatekeeper777 so special.</p><p>Whenever anyone spoke out against Gatekeeper777 at the time, whether it was me or someone else, they were instantly banned for a stupid "naming and shaming" rule which was not even in the terms of service. He was allowed to continue grifing for many months simply because people were too afraid of speaking out and getting banned.<br>I was the only one who had the guts to continue speaking out against him even though I knew I was gonna get banned for it. Yet I still continued on to speak out, and when others saw me speak out, they joined me and helped me take him down once and for all. I even went as far as to sacrifice my original first Gadget57 account just to get rid of him for good.</p><p>I, along with many others have tried messaging the moderators many times with evidence against Gatekeeper777, but our messages were treated as spam messages and they did not bother to open up our messages and read them, so I had to start a riot just to get the moderators attention which led to me getting unfairly banned for naming and shaming. However, the moderators finally took notice and got rid of him.</p><p>This happened a very long time ago now, and we have already moved past that event. The only reason I am even mentioning him now is because I am trying to make the point that, like how there are rules for us normal players to follow, there must also be some rules for moderators and even the high admins like Buzzard to follow to ensure that power abuse does not happen, and that people are not wrongfully banned for small silly things.</p><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_1821694 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1821694">SteveFrench</span></span><cite><p>Or else you risk facing the deletion of your account. <br>If someone steals your password you haven't disclosed your password to someone else or authorised use of it (it wouldn't be "stealing" if you had authorised it- again go use google to find definitions for words if you're struggling, this isn't the place.)</p><p>The mods/crows/whatever are pretty reasonable, if your password gets stolen, report it and you'll be fine.</p></cite><p>You make a very good argument here and I will not deny what you said here, but what if someone starts messaging the moderators and admins claiming that they own your account and that you are a hacker stealing their account even though the account is rightfully yours?

Pretty much, the point of my response there was to point out that you digressed from your original premise (baring in mind we're in the help thread) to petty bad mouthing, which happens quite a lot throughout your post.<br><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_9467672 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="9467672">fuashinoxhf</span></span><cite><br>the word "Accurate" can have multiple meanings, and so can the word "data", so I probably would not understand it so quickly and easily even if I had googled it. Like how accurate should the accurate data be? Also, the term accurate can mean like gun shooting accuracy<br><br>Data can refer to online data, offline data, personal data, shared data, network data, memory data and more.<br><br>If your saying that my data should be correct in details, does my username have to be correct in details? I don't recall ever getting penalized for having non-accurate data anyways, and I don't think anyone else got penalized for it either.</cite></p><p>1.) Accurate primarily refers to something being exact, correct, precise. The other meanings refer to specific situations (such as a gun being accurate) but this still means precise. So accurate data (in answer to your question) needs to be correct, precise, exact, take your pick, the data you input into any particular field won't change according to which you choose.<br>2.) Accuracy is a slightly different word to accurate hence the different definition (seriously, just go look it up!) If the data you enter has an accuracy of 50% it isn't completely accurate. It is only partially accurate. It asks for your data to be accurate, not partially accurate.<br>3.)The data it's referring to is literally defined for you when you set up your account- it's the data that it asks you to fill in (the different fields you're required to fill in to set up an account.) This is simple and is why I didn't put a fully comprehensive definition of data in my post.<br>4.) A username is what you choose it to be, so if you choose to be "sugartitties" you have inputted accurate data if this what you want to be known as I suppose. I would suppose there is a wide variety of reasons why a person may use a username instead of just their real name. It's not asking you for your real name, so by not inputting your real name your not violating the rule.<br>5.) Just because you haven't been penalised for breaking certain rules, or as a matter of fact, if you cannot possibly be found guilty of breaking said rule doesn't mean the rule is invalid and shouldn't be followed. I'm sure in some way or the other someone could molester a child and get away with it, this doesn't mean if we can learned how to get away with it then we should do it. A bit of an extreme example but the point stands (I'm not try to draw parallels between the severity of the 2 breaches of rules FYI) <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Gyges">This may be useful here</a><br> <br><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_9467672 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="9467672">fuashinoxhf</span></span><cite> <br>As if this concept and the validity of the leaderboards hasn't already been ruined due to past grifers like Gatekeeper777. <br><br>It was because the rule regarding naming and shaming was a dumb rule that should not have been put into effect at all.<br><br>Famous people like Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are "named and shamed" all the time, so what makes a grifer like Gatekeeper777 so special.<br><br>I even went as far as to sacrifice my original first Gadget57 account just to get rid of him for good.<br><br>I, along with many others have tried messaging the moderators many times with evidence against Gatekeeper777, but our messages were treated as spam messages and they did not bother to open up our messages and read them, However, the moderators finally took notice and got rid of him.<br>There must also be some rules for moderators and even the high admins<br></cite></p><p>Ok, so I just have to be really careful here because in order to answer a lot of what you've said here I have to trust your account on matter. Which I don't to be honest.<br>1.) The validity of the leaderboards is compromised by griefers (FYI using the official definition of a griefer for this site, which is set out some place or the other) this is part of why it is against the rules. The concept for die2ite is only slightly tarnished by this in my opinion- I mean some people just want to watch the world burn, this applies in real life and on die2nite so there's at least an element of realism brought along with griefing.<br>2.) Although the naming and shaming rule may be a little over the top in some people's opinions, it makes sense that it's there. there's probably no real problem with naming and shaming real griefers, but a single player with the ability to type a forum post doesn't get the authority to decided who is and who isn't in violation of the game's rules. And as such a single player shouldn't have the power to tarnish a player's reputation, after all you may be wrong about the breach of rules. <br>3.) In reference to the American presidential elections comment- I do hope you take the future of one of the biggest societies on Earth more seriously than the rules for a game. But I'm not sure in what way either have been legally named and shamed. Perhaps you can enlighten me.<br>4.) I remember the profile Gadget57 getting into trouble for multiple reason and I myself got sick of seeing you constantly trolling the forums. Before you say your not a troll- in my head if you weren't a troll then you are a child too young to be playing this game in the first place. I don't blame them for ignoring you- please read "the boy who cried wolf." I definitively got the impression the crows felt like they were banging their heads against a brick wall with you. But I should really avoid speaking for other people. <br>5.) Any dealings with the crows that I've had have been fairly reasonable and polite encounters. But I don't vouch for their efficiency in dealing with rule breaks and never have. I don't see how this invalidates the rules themselves. There should be rules for the staff. But again, none of this invalidates the rules in place. (kinda the premise of your post, to reiterate) <br>6.) Finally, they did eventually get rid of him, thank God the rules where there to be enforced, even if it did take some time. Keeping the validity of our leaderboards and the concept for the game safe (as you mentioned, they may have been at risk if something wasn't done.

I don't think it's been specifically mentioned, but I think we're pretty safe in assuming this is a breach in the rules. And it definitely suits the meaning of the word griefing in a general sense. Bare in mind they don't need to write rules to specifically cover griefing in this respect because banning multi-accounts will cover it.</p><p>I'm not going to respond to your second post because this is getting out of hand. I'd probably sum up by repeating: just because you may be able to break a rule and get away with it, doesn't mean that a.) you should do it or b.) that the rule isn't accurate. Also, I don't see how you don't understand a rule (at least so you claim) but you do understand how you could get away with breaking it.</p><p><strong>ALSO, ANYONE WITH THE ABILITY, HE HAS JUST POSTED WITH 2 DIFFERENT PROFILES.

(Hollywood showed me those things btw)</p></cite><p>I would agree here, except that you should not even be comparing making multiple accounts to robbing banks. Im talking about what I do not understand about the terms of service, and here you are making me out like a crooked terrorist.</p><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_70794 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="70794">Dream</span></span><cite><p>just because you "think" you can do something and get away with it without getting caught , that doesnt mean its ok to do it! others lifes in this game or outside it are involved and the consequences for any of your illegal action could be catastrophic for others that makes you not only a rule breaker BUT also an awful person in real life.</p><p>and tbh i believe deep inside that some of those who find it so easy and ok to break the rules online are most likely on a path to be criminals in real life and could easily turn into a dark evil path from their evil thoughts and intentions growing during playing those games.</p><p>so think deep about who you are before you break rules because when the time comes for you to pay for the consequences of your actions, know that the second you refuse to accept the punishment then you are already a criminal and a bad person.</p></cite><p>Again, why are you comparing me to an evil criminal? Aside from simple bans, there is no real punishment going on here.<br>You cannot predict what path I am on, so quit trying. If I really was going to be a terrorist, I would actually be doing bad things rather than just having discussions on an online forum.</p><br><p>Sorry SteveFrench, but I had to cut most your post down a little bit.<br><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_1821694 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1821694">SteveFrench</span></span><cite><br>How we found out: the guy whose account was sabotaged was like "shit! someone's logged onto my account and taken me all this way from town with no hope of getting back, he wasted a shit ton of the towns resources as well in the process" we investigated further by talking with him and discovered the truth of the password sharing. I don't think it's been specifically mentioned, but I think we're pretty safe in assuming this is a breach in the rules. And it definitely suits the meaning of the word griefing in a general sense. Bare in mind they don't need to write rules to specifically cover griefing in this respect because banning multi-accounts will cover it.<br></cite></p><p>Actually, they do have to write rules to specifically cover grifing, and banning multi accounts will hardly cover anything.<br>There is a reason we have an entire thread calling Serious Grifing, which covers grifing and talks about what exactly is grifing.<br>Rules must be specific. When rules are not specific, people will find loop holes to them, making the rules next to pointless. Gatekeeper777 found and exploited a loop hole and was able to grif for an abnormally long time.</p><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_1821694 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1821694">SteveFrench</span></span><cite>I'm not going to respond to your second post because this is getting out of hand. I'd probably sum up by repeating: just because you may be able to break a rule and get away with it, doesn't mean that a.) you should do it or b.) that the rule isn't accurate. Also, I don't see how you don't understand a rule (at least so you claim) but you do understand how you could get away with breaking it.</cite><p>That is because the rule was not accurate, so people find loop holes to them. There should honestly be threads covering all of the rules on the terms of service so people are less likely to find loop holes.</p><p>I do not understand the naming and shaming rule, not because of how I would get away with it, but I do not understand the circumstances to that rule. The main rule regarding grifers was that if someone was grifing in a town and punching players, and taking items from the bank, and running outside to die, you had to follow the rules and send a message to the moderators with evidence of the grifers. It was against the rules to name and shame the player, yes, but following that specific rule just didn't work in most cases.<br>So we originally followed that rule and sent the message with evidence, but most of the time, our messages were treated as spam and the moderators rarely took any action.<br>So we had to go out of our way to try a different method which was to actually break the rule just to get rid of the grifer.</p><p>You should see how I do not understand the rules now. Not just the rules, but how the moderators should deal with these grifers. If the only way to deal with grifers is to send a message to the moderators and wait weeks for them to send a message to Buzzard to take action, then it is just not effective.<br>That is why I came up with better solutions for dealing with grifers like allowing moderators to teleport grifers back into town, immediately shun them, force them to put all the items in the bank, and heal any player that they attacked. This method is better simply because there is no waiting several weeks involved here</p><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_1821694 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1821694">SteveFrench</span></span><cite><strong>ALSO, ANYONE WITH THE ABILITY, HE HAS JUST POSTED WITH 2 DIFFERENT PROFILES. FULL IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE RULES REGARDING MULTIS BECAUSE HE HAS QUOTED THOSE RULES. </strong></cite><p>Don't know why you posted in full bold text, but you failed to make any point here.</p><br><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_1758283 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1758283">Megajef</span></span><cite><p>why do you guys continue to react to him? His posts are made to get a rise out of you and you are playing right into his hand.</p><p>We need to come together as a community and completely ignore him. No logical walls of text, no snarky comments, just silence.</p></cite><p>My posts are not made to get a rise out of anyone, they are made to properly address the rules regarding grifing and having multiple accounts, and how or if someone gets caught.</p><p>You can ignore me, but you cannot ignore what has been going on for a long time. You cannot ignore the fact that moderators should be given the ability to undo the grifers actions rather than having to wait weeks to get a message to Buzzard and risk it never happening due to messages often seen as spam.</p><p>Lastly if everyone here was just "silent" would that not make the entire die2nite forums pointless since the point of a forum is not to be silent, but to actually communicate with others and talk about various things?</p>
