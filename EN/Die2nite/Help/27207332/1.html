However, you have a serious issue with griefers and trolls that YOU HAVE to take care of, and the fact that you ban your paying players for bringing that to light is some F<strong>*ed up S</strong>T.</p><p>You need to understand who you are creating this game for and take a stand between what is understandable game-play (ok everyone is mad at me for a mistake and I'm now going to take advantage), and the gameplay that is completely ruining the game for others and making the game completely unenjoyable for those, like me, that have paid for over a year of Hero ability (I don't care what I join, I will make this game a living hell for those that do play).</p><p>As developers of this game, you need to pick your side. By banning those from the forums that actually want to enjoy the game and play it, you are making a clear statement: you don't give a flying F<strong>* about how the game plays and just want to make money off of this, which is really f</strong>*ing sad. If that is a case...feel free to reimburse me for the 300 + days I have left as a hero because you are clearly selling a product that does not live up to the standards you have described.</p><p>Pick your side...otherwise lose your player-base.

                <p>Let's use little words here.</p><p>The Crow does not work for MT. They are not developers for this game. They have no say how the game operates.</p><p>Your fight isn't with The Crow. Or rather, it shouldn't be. What you and your friends are doing is basically the same as if I told *you* that you need to fix d2n and add certain things to it. <em>You</em> are incapable of it. <em>You</em> have nothing to do with the game. <em>You</em> are really no different from me. Same thing with The Crow.</p><p>Your fight should be with Epoq. He's the administrator of the game and the only one that has the ability to get things to the developers of the game.</p><p>Motion Twin is the company that develops the game and makes the decision. However, they've said time and again that there are certain things that are perfectly allowed - selfish play is one of them.</p><p>Selfish play allows players to actively harm others in the name of getting themselves further. Griefing is the act of harming the town in a way that has no benefit to the player (i.e. taking crucial supplies and going outside to die).</p><p>Selfish play allows players to go after distinctions in whatever way they find necessary. Basically, if there's any sort of reward for the person (LMS, cannibalism, etc), they're allowed to do it however they want.</p><p>If you don't like it, don't play the game. If enough people start actually leaving that it makes a real difference to MT, they'll change it. But not a day before that. See: meta cap. There was a LOT more than 10 or so players screaming and threatening and they still did it. When they realized that people really would, and <strong>did</strong> leave the game, they removed the cap. But one meta screaming bloody murder at the wrong person and abusing the volunteer community moderators is not going to make MT do anything they've repeatedly said they allow and endorse.</p><p>Lay off of the crows and take your fight to the only person that can help you. Especially if someone claims to have a "direct line" to him. The crows are no different from you or me when it comes to what you're demanding.</p>

You don't like how someone is acting? BE BETTER. Outsmart them, use your skills of manipulation and cunning. You can't bully yourself out of a situation you don't like. Not in town and not with the crows.<br><br>The crows can actually do very few things. We can forum ban and moderate posts on the forums. We cannot see town forums unless there's a report and even then we can only see that one thread. We need to see the thread to give us context but otherwise we don't need to nor want to see what goes on in a town unless it goes against the actual rules.<br><br>We have passed on your accusations of griefing, of moderator abuse of power, [insert any concern you message us about in pms or the Dear Crow thread]- all the concerns go to Epoq. From years of doing this job we know what constitutes griefing though and we aren't surprised Epoq isn't all over these "griefers". <br><br>What Spacekadt says is true, the crows have nothing to do with the mechanics of the game. We are playing members of this game like everyone else and we are not paid. <br><br>If you have any other questions for the crows, use the Dear Crow thread. <br></span></p>
