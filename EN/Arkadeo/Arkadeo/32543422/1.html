                <p>There's a <a target="_self" href="/tid/forum#!view/90610|thread/32226810?p=1"><strong>thread</strong></a> on the French forums asking for French players' opinions of Arkadeo thus far. Most of them are rather critical of this site and the way it's been administered thus far, but I think they bring up some valid points. (Automated online translators work well for those who aren't fluent in French, myself included.)</p><p>It's hard to find verifiable metrics on Arkadeo's user numbers, but we can consider this: <br><img src="http://www.kadokado.com/gfx/smileys/there.gif" alt=":kk_there:" class="tid_ico"> The number of Iron Chouquette players in Period 156 (from <img src="http://www.kadokado.com/gfx/smileys/small_level_8.gif" alt=":kk_level8:" class="tid_ico"> to <img src="http://www.kadokado.com/gfx/smileys/small_level_0.gif" alt=":kk_level0:" class="tid_ico">) was 13 520 +/- 100. This was for one game alone, even though it's a very popular one. This is from data I collected.<br><img src="http://www.kadokado.com/gfx/smileys/there.gif" alt=":kk_there:" class="tid_ico"> If we add up all the players registered in a League, there is a <em>maximum</em> of ( 1 + 5 + 13 + 34 + 64 + 60 ) * 50 = 8 850 players. However, numerous leagues have fewer than 50 members, and many of them aren't active. Then again, some players may stick to level-up mode and never join a league.</p><p>I'm not sure if management is already disappointed with Arkadeo's user numbers, which leads to decreased attention/resources being devoted to this site, which leads to even lower user numbers, and so forth...</p>

                <p>Thought for some time if i want to make a big post about this or not, but decided to do it anyway, even though it won't change anything.</p><br><p>There are two main problems with Arkadeo in my opinion. Okay, three, with third being that i don't like most of the games here, primarily for their generic nature, but that's subjective, so whatever.</p><p>First problem is a non-existent support for the games that are already out. I won't even speak about bugs, because what i am really annoyed with, is Pulsar replays desync. Like really, really annoyed. As a potentially buying customer, i have to say that i most probably won't spend a dollar here until this one isn't fixed. <br>It's not even *that* much of a problem in itself, but it just showcases this whole attitude so well. Like, replays are one of the main objective improvements over Kado and you've got a game where replays are not working at all. What do you do? Right, you ignore it completely, even though the problem was obvious in the day of release, maybe even pre-release, in the beta-version of Pulsar, dunno how the beta functions.<br>So, non-existent support.</p><p>Second problem is a flawed design of all game modes.</p><p>1. Still no Clan mode, why? This one should've been here since Arkadeo opening, i was very surprised that it wasn't here, and even more surprised that it's still not released. That's where most of the profit sits usually in this kind of online games, so how do you release a site without it's primary function? This one is really strange for me.</p><p>2. Problem with LevelUp is that it's not replayable. So, it's resetting every season. Okay, but where is the incentive for paying customer to keep playing it every season? For non-paying there is incentive existing in jackpot payouts, but why would paying customer be interested in that? (If his name is not Rukawa, of course :p )<br>*But* this one is not easily fixable, plus it's not that big of a problem compared to others, so whatever, let LevelUp be.</p><p>3. Mission mode is just weird. Does anyone at all play it for fun and not for points after their first month on this site? I seriously ask this, because it may be that i don't understand it, but i just really don't see the appeal. It's supposed to be the mixture of League and LevelUp, but why would i play this instead of these two modes?<br>And okay, even if i decided to play it for some reason, to get at least somewhat decent challenge i have to get through completely boring first missions. Like 1st level in Nosushi, 51k in Green Witch, seriously? <br>How much tokens do i need to pour in to get at least resemblance of a challenge and why would i do that if there is a league mode where i can do this at any moment without any strings attached?</p><p>Now, what could be done about this one is a re-design, for it to be the first mode that is *not* downgrading every season. Then add some achievements for like 10-50-100-250-500 levels, make increment in difficulty not steep, but very smooth, like *very* smooth, and you've got yourself pretty good money grabber. I would still probably not play it (though who knows), but it can bring couple of $k from many other people, i think.<br>But, as we remember, non-existing support, so..</p><p>4. Finally, League mode. It's the most completed mode out here with one big easily solveable problem: no incentive for the players to be first through the cunning use of their Mastercard. Back on Kado there were bigger payouts and recognition for the "best" player through the main page announcements. Afaik, on Arkadeo there isn't even a lousy achievement for that. Why? That's so easy to do.</p><p>What should be done, in my opinion:</p><p>A) Increase points payouts for the first, second and third place in Elite dramatically, to maybe like 60-70k for first (maybe even more), 20-30k for second, 10-15k for third. The thing is, developers aren't losing anything with this, as the bigger payouts will be, the more people will pay to try to grab them. So even the player who will finally get the first place will still spend much more money than he did before, and there are those who spent the money but didn't get the first too...</p><p>B) Get some announcements, to make sure that even a player who didn't played in League at all, knows who was the "best" in previous season. That is reasonably easy to do and should be very effective for egocentrics, which are most of the population in Elite.</p><p>C) Get some achievements, or, even better, medals for the first place in Elite in any season. Or even better, customized medals, with each season being associated with, like, 50x50 pixels unique medal, which will be displayed on the player profile after he gets it. Cost of creating one 50x50 picture every two weeks is really nothing, and, in case of a good design, this little thing would provide a steady income by itself, as the medals would be unique and obtainable only in one season each and ultimately only with the help of a thick purse.<br>Anyway, it's not about medals, but you get the idea. Something *permanent* to be there even after season changes. At least an achievement to get some competition running.</p><br><p>Overall, i am dissappointed with the way developers are approaching this site's management. I feel like it could be so much more than it is now, but seems like it's more interesting for them to create new stuff than to upgrade and polish already released projects. Nothing wrong with that overall, of course, but it's not healthy for Arkadeo, unfortunately.</p>

I can say this with some confidence because Pulsar has game ID #1, and it wasn't a launch game. I think I remember Pulsar disappearing at one point during beta testing</p><br><br><p>And now, how I feel about Arkadeo, along with <span class="tid_strike">unreasonable</span> suggestions<br><cite></cite><strong>LevelUp mode</strong><br>LevelUp mode is mostly fine. A persistent level with a larger level cap would be interesting, but any amount over 50 levels would mean that most levels are automatically generated. That could end up with unbeatable things at high levels</p><p>The current 20 level system is fine, but I despise the penalty for failure. I now have 14 jokers via assorted purchases, but there should be more than just one free joker per season. I feel each game should have like 3 continues per season, and then you can continue to buy off the timer using generic jokers. Giving a user more chances to keep trying at a game sounds like a no-brainer. Having your progress reset after a single failure is arcade-like, but I'm sure it has caused a good amount of confusion and/or player abandonment of the site. And on that note, if these games are supposed to work like an arcade, then why do we have to keep pouring tokens in if we don't lose? That just shows that their decisions aren't intended to invoke an arcade-like experience, but rather, to maximize their potential ROI by making it expensive to finish a game</p><p><strong>League and Mission modes</strong><br>Mission mode in its current incarnation is entirely worthless to me. Why play that at all, if anything you do in there is not going to advance your progress elsewhere? I think that Mission and League mode could benefit from a merger of sorts. Somewhat like KadoKado's Mission steps for its clans, Mission mode on here would basically be an added incentive for you to play a variety of games, while also getting credit in the game rankings. Again, MT shows that they just want people to waste tokens, by having Mission mode scores not count in League mode (I am fine with the inclusion of isolated levels from LU mode, however)</p><p>As for League itself, I also don't like how it's structured. The system is mostly fine, as it encourages localized competition, and doesn't force you to be very best in a game in order to have progress. I strongly dislike how your standing can deteriorate, however. My fantasy setup would be to have something like KadoKado, but with a continued focus on overall performance. Basically, there would not be groups of players, just players in a certain ranking level. Going up a level will require you to be in the top [number] of players, based on your scores that season, across all games. In addition, the player with the best score in each game will go up a level. Going up a level will give a <img src="http://arkadeo.com/img/icons/pkSmall.png" alt=":ark_pk:" class="tid_ico"> bonus, and that's it. Staying in a level would not give you points. The rules change once you're in Elite, as you then can get <img src="http://arkadeo.com/img/icons/pkSmall.png" alt=":ark_pk:" class="tid_ico"> bonuses for being at the top of the overall rankings, and/or having the best score in a single game<br><br>I feel that system combines what's good about the two "kado"s into one. It also prevents issues with the site becoming less popular, and preventing people from going up levels. Even if the amount of level ups are determined by the number of active players in a league level, there are still a certain number of guaranteed level ups by way of people having the top score in a game (among the users at a particular league level)<br><br><strong>Clan mode</strong><br>It doesn't exist yet, and I'm not particularly annoyed by that. Given how all the modes are isolated from each other, I doubt I'll look at clans until I'm done grinding out the various League-related icons. Hopefully, by that time, most of the people who would be threats in League will have gone over to clans, to afford me the opportunity to do well <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_calim.gif" alt=":hordes_calim:" class="tid_ico"><br><br><br><em>tl;dr: WHINE WHINE WHINE MAKE THINGS MORE LIKE KADOKADO WHINE WHINE WHINE</em></p>
