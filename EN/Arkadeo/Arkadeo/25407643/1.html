It's an adult game targeted at adults with adult sensibilities and it's up to the parents to monitor what their children play. Arkadeo, however, is none of those things. Arkadeo is a cartoony colourful game service filled with simple minigames, lacking depth, intelligent stimuli or any other factor to target at a more mature audience. It's the kinda game parents expect to be fine with their children, yet it's filled with covert alcoholism and violence.</p><p><cite>Alright, how about adjusting the Quran with something like "Thou shalt not play any games that Muhammad didn't try first".

It's an adult game targeted at adults with adult sensibilities and it's up to the parents to monitor what their children play. Arkadeo, however, is none of those things. Arkadeo is a cartoony colourful game service filled with simple minigames, lacking depth, intelligent stimuli or any other factor to target at a more mature audience. It's the kinda game parents expect to be fine with their children, yet it's filled with covert alcoholism and violence.</cite><br>In case you are so paranoic, no one forbids you to monitor what your children do on the internet.<br>The level of "alcoholism and violence" here is perfectly acceptable for me and for the majority of us. Especially when compared to the primary entertainment source for children, that is the TV.</p><p><cite>Is there a reason you bring up the Qur'an and Prophet Muhammad (la ilaha illa 'llah, Muhammadun-Rasulullah)? I know it's a fad to make fun of religion in the internet but this comes across totally off the left field and only meant as a insensitive, hateful comment.</cite><br>Yeah, probably insensitive. Not hateful though. In my opinion it was funny. Clearly, we don't share the same sense of humour. In fact, if you didn't notice, my whole post was not meant to be serious, rather ironic. Or sarcastic, if you prefer.<br>I brought it up because you mentioned your country. I'm not guessing which one is it, but it's clearly one of those where the laws are radicated in the Islamic religion.<br>You are acculturated enough to realize that you're dealing with people with a cultural background much different than yours. I mean both the game designers and in a great deal also the players. We're not supposed to share your opinions and your values. What is a threat for you might just be considered harmless for us and in general in our societies. Or even funny. In my country we use to say that adaptation is a sign of intelligence. That's supposed to apply when you're outside your "natural environment".</p><p><cite>Mental image marketing of alcohol to children is illegal in a quite a few of the most intelligent, socially secure and advanced countries in the world so I wouldn't brush it off like that.</cite><br>I'm not going to debate on what you define as mental imagery and where it is illegal because I'm not interested in making you change your opinion or going through laws in different countries. I'm just going to give you a suggestion: when you have a problem with a game, posting on the forum will lead you to nowhere. In the best case scenario you'll find the support of some weirdos like the one with Asperger Syndrome. Or you'll be bantered and if the thing goes too far, someone sooner or later will lock the thread. That should remind you of the end of what you called "public outrage".<br>If you are serious about your concerns, message Epoq, the English speaking admin. If you think the game is breaking some laws, take legal actions. Otherwise just accept that the things will stay in the original way and act accordingly.<br>These forum protests are really laughable and seem to be asking for what you get in return, that is ad hominem mockery.</p>
