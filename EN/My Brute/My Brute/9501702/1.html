                Why is it that some people are so devoid of a sense of humor? Naturally, I'm referring to MyBrute's latest tractates. Please note that many of the conclusions I'm about to draw are based on cogent and virtually incontrovertible evidence provided by a set of people who have suffered immensely on account of MyBrute.<br><br>I will not let myself be forced into anything. More than that, MyBrute managed to convince a bunch of the most loathsome freebooters I've ever seen to help it help coldhearted, intemperate neurotic-types back up their prejudices with "scientific" proof. What was the quid pro quo there? No, don't guess; this isn't audience participation day. I'll just tell you. But before I do, you should note that if anything will free us from the shackles of its bitter prophecies, it's knowledge of the world as it really is. It's knowledge that I recently checked out one of MyBrute's recent tracts. Oh, look; it's again saying that a book of its writings would be a good addition to the Bible. Raise your hand if you're surprised. Seriously, though, back when our policemen were guardians, not enforcers, they would have protected us from MyBrute's band. Today, it seems that most officers of the law are content to sit back and let MyBrute extend its fifteen minutes of fame to fifteen months. That's why we must criticize its demands publicly for their formalistic categories, their spurious claims of neutrality, and their blindness to the abuse of private power.<br><br>MyBrute says that it can succeed without trying. But then it turns around and says that its hatchet jobs are a breath of fresh air amid our modern culture's toxic cloud of chaos. You know, you can't have it both ways, MyBrute. So let me make it clear that MyBrute's claim that its junta is looking out for our best interests requires a willing suspension of disbelief, an ability to set logic aside and accept any preposterous notion that MyBrute throws at us.<br><br>I recently received some mail in which the writer stated, "Only by striving to catalogue MyBrute's swindles and perversions can I bring a fresh perspective and new ideas to the current debate." I included that quote not because it is exceptional in any way but rather because it is typical of much of the mail I receive. I included it to show you that I'm not the only one who thinks that MyBrute may have access to weapons of mass destruction. Then again, I consider it to be a weapon of mass destruction itself. Inasmuch as I disagree with MyBrute's accusations and find its ad hominem attacks offensive, I am happy to meet MyBrute's speech with more speech and, if necessary, continue this discussion until the truth shines. While I don't question MyBrute's motives, and I certainly understand the frustrations of its spokesmen, its claim that we should avoid personal responsibility is not only an attack on the concept of objectivity but an assault on the human mind. If MyBrute thinks that it can make me hang myself by the neck until dead then it's barking up the wrong tree.<br><br>We've tolerated MyBrute's domineering refrains long enough. It's time to lose our patience and chill our kindness. It's time to condemn MyBrute's criminal ineptitude. It's time to shout to the world that it uses language that would make a sailor blush. (Yes, it apparently wants to use us to fulfill its simple-minded mission, but that's a different story.)<br><br>When MyBrute was first found rubbing salt into our wounds, I was scared. I was scared not only for my personal safety; I was scared for the people I love. And now that MyBrute is planning to exploit other cultures for self-entertainment, I'm downright terrified. Some people apparently believe that if we don't bother MyBrute, MyBrute won't bother us. The fallacy of that belief is that our desires and its are not merely different; they are opposed in mortal enmity. MyBrute wants to waste our time and money. We, in contrast, want to alert people that it has been known to dupe people into believing that it knows 100% of everything 100% of the time. That always spurs on its jackals to drag men out of their beds in the dead of night and castrate them. That, in turn, encourages MyBrute to treat traditional values as if they were peevish crimes. This cycle inevitably, inexorably ratchets upwards and outwards until at last some illogical yahoo winds up fighting with spiritual weapons that are as abusive as they are sniveling.<br><br>In the strictest sense, MyBrute is not your average sophomoric dunderhead. It's the deluxe model. As such, it's indisputably poised to undermine everyone's capacity to see, or change, the world as a whole eventually. If MyBrute succeeds in its attempt to give lunatics control of the asylum, it'll have to be over my dead body.<br><br>Yes, MyBrute may have some superficial charm, but I intend to look closely at its allocutions to see what makes them so effectual at fragmenting the nation into politically disharmonious units. I should expect to find—this is a guess that I currently lack sufficient knowledge to verify—that life is a search for the true, the good, and the beautiful. It is not, as MyBrute believes, an excuse to identify political and religious groups that are its political enemies and re-label them as "disruptive, unconscionable Philistines" in order to justify operations against them. The simple, regrettable truth is that MyBrute's rantings are eerily similar to those promoted by madmen such as Pol Pot. What's scary, though, is that their extollment of gnosticism has been ratcheted up a few notches from anything Pol Pot ever conjured up. Still, we shouldn't jump to conclusions, even though it is a known fact that MyBrute, already oppressive with its otiose fusillades, will perhaps be the ultimate exterminator of our human species—if separate species we be—for its reserve of unguessed horrors could never be borne by mortal brains if loosed upon the world. If you think that that's a frightening thought then consider that MyBrute's encomiasts have been arrested in numerous murders, violent assaults, and bank robberies across the nation. I'll probably devote a separate letter to that topic alone, but for now I'll simply summarize by stating that mandarinism is dangerous. MyBrute's cruel version of it is doubly so.<br><br>Are you still with me? Do we not, as rational men and women, owe it to both our heritage and our posterity to cast a gimlet eye on MyBrute's précis? I think we do. The spectrum of views between pharisaism and cannibalism is not a line but a circle at which crafty incubi and credentialism-prone storytellers meet. To properly place MyBrute somewhere in that spectrum one needs to realize that one does not have to take us all back to the Stone Age in order to bear the flambeau of freedom. It is an ophidian person who believes otherwise.<br><br>MyBrute's goal is to do exactly the things it accuses malodorous, censorious kleptomaniacs of doing. This is abject ageism! MyBrute takes things out of context, twists them around, and then neglects to provide decent referencing so the reader can check up on it. It also ignores all of the evidence that doesn't support (or in many cases directly contradicts) its position. Those of you who thought that MyBrute was finally going to leave us alone are in for a big surprise because MyBrute recently announced its plans to project a stream of hypersensitive images of death, sex, disaster, material goods, celebrities, and other fixtures in a mock-Olympian firmament. It's quixotic for MyBrute to enslave us, suppress our freedom, regiment our lives, confiscate our property, and dictate our values. Or perhaps I should say, it's addlepated. People sometimes ask me why I seem incapable of saying anything nice about MyBrute. I'd like to—really, I would. The problem is, I can't think of anything nice to say. I guess that's not surprising when you consider that if you are not smart enough to realize this, then you become the victim of your own ignorance. Okay, I've written enough for one letter, so let me just finish by saying that we may never learn the answers to some of the more vexing questions surrounding MyBrute's motives.

                Why can't MyBrute state the facts straightforwardly without their being exaggerated, aggrandized, altered, fiddled with, dressed up, falsified, and, in short, MyBrute-ized? If you've ever wondered about the answer to that question, then read on. Before I begin talking about specifics, let me just mention that if you think that a knowledge of correct diction, even if unused, evinces a superiority that covers cowardice or stupidity then you're suffering from very serious nearsightedness. You're focusing too much on what MyBrute wants you to see and failing to observe many other things of much greater importance such as that he wants us to believe that priggism and alcoholism are identical concepts. How stupid does he think we are? The most appealing theory has to do with the way that his followers profess that governments should have the right to lie to their own subjects or to other governments. I say to them, "Prove it"—not that they'll be able to, of course, but because MyBrute's expositions celebrate deception, diversion, and fashion. But you knew that already. So let me add that most effete, dirty sewer rats think, "credo, quia absurdum" when they hear MyBrute say that granting him complete control over our lives is as important as breathing air. I'll stand by that controversial statement and even assume that most readers who bring their own real-life experience will agree with it. At a bare minimum, MyBrute looks primarily at a person's superficial qualities such as physiognomy and mannerisms. I, in contrast, consider how likely a person is to speak out against disgusting popinjays. That's what's important to me. Either way, he cannot tolerate the world as it is. He needs to live in a world of fantasies. To be more specific, MyBrute's blandishments are becoming increasingly disloyal. They have already begun to tear down all theoretical frameworks for addressing the issue. Now fast-forward a few years to a time in which they have enabled MyBrute to irritate an incredible number of people. If you don't want such a time to come then help me develop a rational-empirical base for dialogue about MyBrute's strictures. Help me focus on what unites rather than divides us.<br><br>It seems to me that MyBrute is both amoral and muddleheaded. Now there's a dangerous combination if I've ever seen one. Trumpeted so many times, his modes of thought have begun to feed on themselves, to generate their own publicity, to cow MyBrute's critics not by argument but by sheer repetition, and to subject human beings to indignities. You may be shocked to hear this, but he has certainly never given evidence of thinking extensively. Or at all, for that matter. While the question of who is right and who is wrong in this case is an interesting one, it is also something that I cannot and will not comment on, and not just because Nature is a wonderful teacher. For instance, the lesson that Nature teaches us from newly acephalous poultry is that you really don't need a brain to run around like a dang fool making a spectacle of yourself. Nature also teaches us that MyBrute and his followers are what I call randy bullies. This is not set down in complaint against them but merely as analysis.<br><br>MyBrute is a man utterly without honor, without principles, without a shred of genuine patriotism. That's why I say that when people say that bigotry and hate are alive and well, they're right. And MyBrute is to blame. It's easy for us to shake our heads at his foolishness and cowardice. It's easy for us to exclaim that we should say "no" to his sanguinary, combative treatises. It's easy for us to say, "MyBrute feeds on our goodwill like worms feed on buried corpses." The point is that it's easy for us to say these things because the suggestion that obscurity, evasiveness, incomprehensibility, indirectness, and ambiguity are marks of depth and brilliance is wrong, absurd, and offensive. Nevertheless, MyBrute's legatees like to suggest such things to distract attention from the truth, which is that MyBrute periodically puts up a façade of reform. However, underneath the pretty surface, it's always business as usual.<br><br>Are we going to step back and let MyBrute shift blame from those who benefit from oppression to those who suffer from it? I can tell you this: I will be speaking out—every day and everywhere—to make sure that we do not. There is a proper place in life for hatred. Hatred of that which is wrong is a powerful and valuable tool. But when MyBrute perverts hatred in order to let advanced weaponry fall into the hands of what I call peevish parvenus, it becomes clear that some reputed—as opposed to reputable—members of his peuplade quite adamantly assert that "metanarratives" are the root of tyranny, lawlessness, overpopulation, racial hatred, world hunger, disease, and rank stupidity. I find it rather astonishing that anyone could suspect such a thing, but then again, one of MyBrute's favorite tricks is to create a problem and then to offer the solution. Naturally, it's always his solutions that grant him the freedom to pit race against race, religion against religion, and country against country, never the original problem.<br><br>Before MyBrute spews any more psychoanalytical drivel, let me assure him that this is a lesson for those with eyes to see. It is a lesson not so much about his grotty behavior but about the way that he wants nothing less than to change children's values from those taught in the home to those considered chic by the worst sorts of ridiculous ignoramuses there are, hence his repeated, almost hypnotic, insistence on the importance of his hate-filled obloquies. The central paradox of his inclinations, the twist that makes his metanarratives so irresistible to testy euphuists, is that these people truly believe that space gods arriving in flying saucers will save humanity from self-destruction.<br><br>Although chimpanzees can be convinced to wear clothing, understand commands, and even ride bicycles (if well paid for their services in bananas), it would be virtually impossible to convince MyBrute that what he is doing is not an innocent, recreational sort of thing. It is a criminal activity, it is an immoral activity, it is a socially destructive activity, and it is a profoundly pusillanimous activity. Isn't it odd that destructive bludgers, whose sullen lifestyle will harm others or even instill the fear of harm, by next weekend, are immune from censure? Why is that? This is not a question that we should run away from. Rather, it is something that needs to be addressed quickly and directly because MyBrute has got to go—and yesterday isn't soon enough. He doesn't simply want people to believe that his publications are Right with a capital R. He wants this belief drummed into people's heads from birth. He wants it to be accepted as an axiom, an assumed part of the nature of reality. Only then will MyBrute truly be able to get away with tipping the scales in his favor.<br><br>Maybe you, too, want to dispense outright misinformation and flashlight-under-the-chin ghost stories, so let me warn you: MyBrute's perverted slaves censor any incomplicitous histrionics for no better reason than to be above someone on the social ladder. That's probably obvious to a blind man on a galloping horse. Nevertheless, I suspect that few people reading this letter are aware that MyBrute is not only immoral but amoral. When a political condition of greed, massive corruption, and diversity of objective is coupled to a social condition of drugs, violence, and discontent, therein exists the perfect environment for MyBrute to teach conceited concepts to children. When a mistake is made, the smart thing to do is to admit it and reverse course. That takes real courage. The way that MyBrute stubbornly refuses to own up to his mistakes serves only to convince me that I need your help if I'm ever to encourage opportunity, responsibility, and community. "But I'm only one person," you might protest. "What difference can I make?" The answer is: a lot more than you think. You see, it's MyBrute's belief that my letters demonstrate a desire to ruin people's lives. I can't understand how anyone could go from anything I ever wrote to such an unreasonable idea. In fact, my letters generally make the diametrically opposite claim, that MyBrute makes a lot of exaggerated claims. All of these claims need to be scrutinized as carefully as a letter of recommendation from a job applicant's mother. Consider, for example, MyBrute's claim that his musings are intelligent, commonsensical, and entirely consonant with the views of ordinary people. The fact of the matter is that he and other voices of teetotalism have joined in a chorus singing the praises of drawing young children into his bloody-minded way of life. Or, to express that sentiment without all of the emotionally charged lingo, today, we might have let him substitute pap for art. Tomorrow, we won't. Instead, we will allay the concerns of the many people who have been harmed by MyBrute.<br><br>I have a dream, a mission, a set path that I would like to travel down. Specifically, my goal is to defend with dedication and ferocity the very rights that MyBrute so desperately wants to abolish. Of course, the impact of his biased crotchets is exactly that predicted by the Book of Revelation. Evil will preside over the land. Injustice will triumph over justice, chaos over order, futility over purpose, superstition over reason, and lies over truth. Only when humanity experiences this Hell on Earth will it fully appreciate that MyBrute believes that arriving at a true state of comprehension is too difficult and/or time-consuming. Sorry, but I have to call foul on that one.<br><br>Quite simply, if MyBrute's loyalists had even an ounce of integrity they would convince the worst kinds of lawless crackpots there are to stop supporting MyBrute and tolerating his ventures. He claims that elected national governments are not accountable to their own people. Predictably, he cites no hard data for that claim. This is because no such data exist. I don't need to tell you that it is utterly ridiculous that I have to be faced with imbeciles whose uncongenial apothegms are constantly treated with apathy. That should be self-evident. What is less evident is that MyBrute, already oppressive with his villainous philippics, will perhaps be the ultimate exterminator of our human species—if separate species we be—for his reserve of unguessed horrors could never be borne by mortal brains if loosed upon the world. If you think that that's a frightening thought then consider that formal education is no guarantor of intelligence. At the risk of sounding a tad redundant, let me add that MyBrute's ramblings have experienced a considerable amount of evolution (or perhaps more accurately, genetic drift) over the past few weeks. They used to be simply morbid. Now, not only are they both demonic and irritable, but they also serve as unequivocal proof that every time MyBrute tries, he gets increasingly successful in his attempts to perpetuate myths that glorify radicalism. This dangerous trend means not only death for free thought but for imagination as well.<br><br>So who's crazy? I, or all the closed-minded casuists who feel that MyBrute's platitudes provide a liberating insight into life, the universe, and everything? Before you answer, let me point out that MyBrute's projects, though creative, are a yawning abyss of obstructionism. Let's be sure that I've made myself absolutely clear: I frequently talk about how you can hear the crwth's fremescent clangor every time MyBrute tries to "solve" all our problems by talking them to death. I would drop the subject except that we cannot and we must not allow ourselves to become infected with the fatal germs of nepotism. I will now cite the proof of that statement. The proof begins with the observation that if MyBrute succeeds in his attempt to use terms of opprobrium such as "conscienceless swindlers" and "self-deceiving weirdos" to castigate whomever he opposes, it'll have to be over my dead body. In closing, we must do everything in our power to make plans and carry them out. The fight must go on.<br><a href="http://www.pakin.org/complaint" target="_top">http://www.pakin.org/complaint</a>

                I think When MyBrute was first found rubbing salt into our wounds, I was scared. I was scared not only for my personal safety; I was scared for the people I love. And now that MyBrute is planning to exploit other cultures for self-entertainment, I'm downright terrified. Some people apparently believe that if we don't bother MyBrute, MyBrute won't bother us. The fallacy of that belief is that our desires and its are not merely different; they are opposed in mortal enmity. MyBrute wants to waste our time and money. We, in contrast, want to alert people that it has been known to dupe people into believing that it knows 100% of everything 100% of the time. That always spurs on its jackals to drag men out of their beds in the dead of night and castrate them. That, in turn, encourages MyBrute to treat traditional values as if they were peevish crimes. This cycle inevitably, inexorably ratchets upwards and outwards until at last some illogical yahoo winds up fighting with spiritual weapons that are as abusive as they are sniveling.<br><br>In the strictest sense, MyBrute is not your average sophomoric dunderhead. It's the deluxe model. As such, it's indisputably poised to undermine everyone's capacity to see, or change, the world as a whole eventually. If MyBrute succeeds in its attempt to give lunatics control of the asylum, it'll have to be over my dead body.<br><br>Yes, MyBrute may have some superficial charm, but I intend to look closely at its allocutions to see what makes them so effectual at fragmenting the nation into politically disharmonious units. I should expect to find—this is a guess that I currently lack sufficient knowledge to verify—that life is a search for the true, the good, and the beautiful. It is not, as MyBrute believes, an excuse to identify political and religious groups that are its political enemies and re-label them as "disruptive, unconscionable Philistines" in order to justify operations against them. The simple, regrettable truth is that MyBrute's rantings are eerily similar to those promoted by madmen such as Pol Pot. What's scary, though, is that their extollment of gnosticism has been ratcheted up a few notches from anything Pol Pot ever conjured up. Still, we shouldn't jump to conclusions, even though it is a known fact that MyBrute, already oppressive with its otiose fusillades, will perhaps be the ultimate exterminator of our human species—if separate species we be—for its reserve of unguessed horrors could never be borne by mortal brains if loosed upon the world. If you think that that's a frightening thought then consider that MyBrute's encomiasts have been arrested in numerous murders, violent assaults, and bank robberies across the nation. I'll probably devote a separate letter to that topic alone, but for now I'll simply summarize by stating that mandarinism is dangerous. MyBrute's cruel version of it is doubly so.<br><br><span class="tid_mod">Ok that's enough spam. - norby89</span>
