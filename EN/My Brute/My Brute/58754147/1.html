                <p>Hi there,<br>I am a player of MyBrute for 8 years now. As many other players I think there is an <strong>unreasonable point</strong> in tournament system of the Muxxu version. The winners of the tournament <strong>won't be able</strong> to join in another tournament unless they <strong>reset</strong> to level 1 and <strong>start all over again</strong>. This is <strong>unfair</strong>, making their game boring and their training slow down! On the other hand, if they can join in another tournament with the weaker brutes then the weak brutes will find it more difficult to rank up or to choose a new destiny.<br>So I have a solution for this issue: The tournament winners will have an option to stay at their rank <strong>without losing</strong> their XP, on the contrary <strong>receive XP</strong> from their wins. From now on, they can join in a tournament as usual but <strong>all members</strong> of that tournament must be the one who <strong>ever win</strong> the tournament of this rank. This is for <strong>assurance of justice</strong> for the weaker brutes who haven't win a tournament of this rank. <strong>In conclusion, winners with winners, losers with losers</strong>.<br>Thank you for reading my long post. Looking forward to your reply <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>This is actually a really good idea, you took into account the argument against staying at a rank after winning a tournament. Alot of people just say "We should be able to leave the tournament, stay in the same rank and enter a new one" without realizing that this will pretty much make it so brutes new in the rank will be stuck there for eternity since it will be impossible to compete with brutes that have won various tournaments already and just farm exp.</p><p>Something people have mentioned in the past has been tournaments categorized by levels instead of ranks. Like a tournament brutes level 50-60 can enter, regardless of rank. Maybe make it so brutes in lower ranks have to fight an additional bracket, just so brutes in higher ranks get the advantage they deserve since they had to climb up the ranks already.</p><p>There's alot of ideas that can be implemented into the stale tournament system that this game has, but it's almost impossible that after 6 years they'll do anything about it. Still, it's fun to think about.</p>

                <p>Hello Abel, I don't really understand Muxxu/Twinoid's stance about this game, and I would like to hear your opinion about it, as you seem to be very knowledgeable about MyBrute (you are also involved in the useful MyBrute wiki, if I remember correctly).</p><p>After many years of basically no support (zero new features, bugs/glitches never fixed etc.) it appears that there are still surprisingly many players around, so why Twinoid does think there is still value in this game? <br>They could add some new features and options (like a refurbished tournamente system), and allow some (most?) of these in exchange for muxxu coins. <br>I understand they are a company and so they are in it for profit – that's totally legit: and I am sure many long-term and dedicated players would be happy to pay a little money to get their hands on these shiny new options.</p><p>On the other hand, if Twinoids has concluded that this game is not bringing them enough value, how come they still leave it around after so many years? (They still have expenses connected with it, like the servers, I'd guess).</p><p>Thank you.</p>

                <p>Thanks for your reply. I did think about a fair rule for the tournament to ensure everyone has the same opportunity. Until now I haven't seen my idea has an unfair point.<br>As the lovely brutes have become our soulmates for almost 10 years now, we still hope someday MyBrute Team will move their lazy ass <img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/lol.gif" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p>

(They still have expenses connected with it, like the servers, I'd guess).</p><p>Thank you.</p></cite><p>Hello <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> First of all, I'm really glad to hear that the wiki has been helpful. I really wanted there to be a place where everyone can contribute to make sure it's factual and easy to navigate. I consider it pretty much finished but I would like to hear suggestions.</p><p>In regards to the Motion Twin's stance on MyBrute, I remember it being pretty clear since it came out that it wasn't going to be updated, and it was a real bummer. There was one time that I recall an administrator hosting an event of some sort. This was the Chaos Dentist event that epoq held in 2011, which was tokens that were awarded to the first few Chaos Dentists. Aside from that, I've seen some awkward events held by a guy in the Spanish server that awarded a title. No idea if there's been events in the French server, I don't check the forums.</p><p>I actually think there still might be some players paying for tokens, I know it's been at least two years since I've bought my last tokens (which I still have some left over), but regardless, they should be aware that it's their fault that people eventually got sick of the game to the point of it being a chore. I believe this game is their most popular and successful out of the original Muxxu games. Not sure if you heard about the game they abandoned, Drakarnage, which was suppose to be a spin off of MyBrute or something like that. They even left the game's forum up.</p><p>It's a real bummer that a game that I enjoyed so much is dying. I still check the forums daily. If you're confused on them leaving the game up, it should be more confusing that they still have the original MyBrute and Carapass up. At least MyBrute 2.0 still gets some money off tokens. I tried to support this game since I've been here. Even those 2 mobile games I purchased lol.<br><cite>Sorry, I mistyped! <br>I meant: why Twinoid does NOT think there is still value in this game?</cite><br>Even regular interactions with its players would keep interest. The Chaos Dentist event was kinda just thrown out there.</p>

As many other players I think there is an <strong>unreasonable point</strong> in tournament system of the Muxxu version. The winners of the tournament <strong>won't be able</strong> to join in another tournament unless they <strong>reset</strong> to level 1 and <strong>start all over again</strong>. This is <strong>unfair</strong>, making their game boring and their training slow down! On the other hand, if they can join in another tournament with the weaker brutes then the weak brutes will find it more difficult to rank up or to choose a new destiny.<br>So I have a solution for this issue: The tournament winners will have an option to stay at their rank <strong>without losing</strong> their XP, on the contrary <strong>receive XP</strong> from their wins. From now on, they can join in a tournament as usual but <strong>all members</strong> of that tournament must be the one who <strong>ever win</strong> the tournament of this rank. This is for <strong>assurance of justice</strong> for the weaker brutes who haven't win a tournament of this rank. <strong>In conclusion, winners with winners, losers with losers</strong>.<br>Thank you for reading my long post. Looking forward to your reply <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></cite><p>I agree, with similar reasoning to Abel. This would be an excellent change to tournaments.</p><br><br><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_2004468 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="2004468">Abel</span></span><cite><p>Well, I know any kind of support for this game in specific is unavailable but you can give it a shot.</p><a target="_blank" href="https://motion-twin.com/en/contact"></a><a href="https://motion-twin.com/en/contact" target="_blank">https://motion-twin.com/en/contact</a><p>I wouldn't be surprised if they don't show interest though.

Same goes for active Admins. There is no active admin in dinorpg anymore. They haven't done another since. My guess is that MT is looking elsewhere to make cash while still keeping this going and only turning up for basic maintenance issues.</p>

                <p>The game isn't flawed in a way that makes such a difference. The glitches that affect an outcome the most are the tournament win glitch and the Backup initiative glitch. Only the former causes any upsets, since the Backup glitch only activated in favor of the user who is training their brute and doesn't happen in tournaments. The game is stale, but not flawed in my opinion.</p>

                <p>Speaking of tournament win glitches. I've seen it from time to time but last week one of my brutes won the tournament two days in a row without getting an ear. It hasn't won more than one fight each day since. No biggie.</p>
