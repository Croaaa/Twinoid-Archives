                I will do my best to make my arguments against Mybrute clear and articulate. I plan to utilize numerous examples and maybe even some occasional humor so as not to strain your patience as I delve into immense detail about how Mybrute's position that everything is happy and fine and good is based upon a specious argument without any substantive basis. Before I launch into my main topic, I want to make a few matters crystal-clear: (1) Its unregenerate, malignant asseverations are a sin against nature, and (2) as a result of that, it is a bacillus in the whiney gut of credentialism. Now that you know where I stand on those issues, I can safely say that it's completely inconsistent in its views. On one hand, it insists that we should cast our lots with overweening oligarchs. But on the other hand, it favors legitimating irresponsibility, laziness, and infidelity. How much clearer do I have to explain things before you can see its hypocrisy?<br><br>So maybe Mybrute is not interested in a true and honest improvement of social conditions but rather in a way to make human life negligible and cheap. Big deal. What's more important is that on several occasions I have heard it state that it is the way, the truth, and the light. I am not able to rightly apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a comment. What I consider far more important though is that Mybrute sees itself as a postmodern equivalent of Marx's proletariat, revolutionizing the world by wresting it from its oppressors (viz., those who maintain the great principles of virtue, truth, right, and honor).<br><br>Don't let yourself be persuaded by rude spivs who secretly want to dismantle the guard rails that protect society from the stultiloquent elements in its midst. Of all the delusions I have ever known, the most gruesome is the idea that Mybrute is a master of precognition, psychokinesis, remote viewing, and other undeveloped human capabilities. Still, that doesn't prevent Mybrute from obfuscating the issue so that one can't see what ought to be thoroughly obvious to all. It would help if Mybrute realized that education and wisdom aren't necessarily the same thing. But there are other strains of fork-tongued fanaticism active today and the siren calls of those movements may mesmerize flighty pettifoggers whose conniving fervor blinds them to historical lessons.<br><br>If one needs a sign that Mybrute is dodgy, then consider that it wants to get me thrown in jail. It can't cite a specific statute that I've violated, but it does believe that there must be some statute. This tells me that Mybrute is neither morally nor intellectually consistent. If it were, it wouldn't first produce a large number of entirely self-aggrandizing extravagancies, most bitter indecencies, and, above all, the most drossy blasphemies against everything that I hold most sacred and most dear then afterwards decry my observation that it had promised us liberty, equality, and fraternity. Instead, Mybrute gave us revisionism, moral relativism, and parasitism. I suppose we should have seen that coming, especially since Mybrute's initiatives are a logical absurdity, a series of deductions from a premise that has been denied. Speaking of absurdities, by writing this letter, I am surely sticking my head far above the parapet. The big danger is that Mybrute will retaliate against me. It'll most likely try to force me to cower before the emotions and accusations of others although another possibility is that it is totally condescending, as it has proved to my complete satisfaction.<br><br>Now, lest you jump to the conclusion that superstition is no less credible than proven scientific principles, I assure you that if I try really, really hard, I can almost see why it would want to commit senseless acts of violence against anyone daring to challenge its dysfunctional doctrines. It's a pity that two thousand years after Christ, the voices of daft underachievers like Mybrute can still be heard, worse still that they're listened to, and worst of all that anyone believes them. Colonialism is a plague upon us all, a pox that will likely not be erased in the lifetime of any reader of this letter. To Mybrute, however, it's merely a convenient mechanism for mobilizing support for the special interests that dominate state and private activity. One last thing: Mybrute has begun—without so much as a by-your-leave—an effort to advocate its half-measures amid a hue and cry as asinine as it is reprehensible.<br><br><strong><em>MAKE your own complaints.
