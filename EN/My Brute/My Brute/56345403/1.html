                <p>This is an idea I came up with about a week ago. Maybe we can all post our brutes and how they are currently doing right now, maybe even get some advice from others by reading about your brutes current situation. Hope to hear from you guys, I'll start.</p><br><p>The Rogue - <a href="http://mybrute.muxxu.com/fight/146046671?chk=74fd" target="_blank">http://mybrute.muxxu.com/fight/146046...</a></p><br><p>He's my best brute right now. BL in his early 20s. He has an extremely slow start on his current destiny, but finally got the frying pan again at level 23. I've gotten up to level 31 with him and that's when he gets counter-attack. I plan on just leveling him up now as he's brutal legend and don't feel like dealing with his slow start again.</p><br><p>The Adept - <a href="http://mybrute.muxxu.com/fight/146046707?chk=198a" target="_blank">http://mybrute.muxxu.com/fight/146046...</a></p><br><p>This brute finally got good about 2 ranks ago. I really like his current set up but it could definitely be better. For example, he only has 1 stat booster, vitality, at level 25. That's the only negative for me right now. He's at Haemogoblin rank right now, and I don't plan on ranking up when he finally wins the tournament either. His start isn't as slow as Rogue's, but for now I'd rather just level him up.</p><br><p>#Tupac - <a href="http://mybrute.muxxu.com/fight/146046753?chk=8002" target="_blank">http://mybrute.muxxu.com/fight/146046...</a></p><br><p>This brute is pretty bad right now. He's a vitality immortal, so he gets around 100 hp from endurance 3, thing is he hasn't gotten that in around 10 or so levels. What's worse is I've decided to not take any weapons for him. About 5 of his last 7 levels were speed +2s, which does basically nothing. Other then the bear and his hp tanking fights, this brute has pretty much nothing. I'm leveling him up though and hoping the best.</p>

I was ranking up Rogue up until about 2 months ago, and from my experience the last 4 or so ranks were pretty slow for tournaments. Dentist of Chaos surprised me the most though. Not only did it take 2-3 days to get a tournament going, but I also had to face level 4 brutes at level 3, not enough level 3 brutes on that rank at the time. Brutal legend is the exact opposite though, it's like being on Padawan again, only you're waiting for 64 rather than 8. I expected it to be fast since people collect ears, but I didn't expect it to be this fast.</p><br><p>Also that's what I did to get my 3rd brute Tupac, I grinded battlesheep on arkadeo and got like 10 jackpots off that game, probably about 8,000-10,000 gift points, then I discovered arkadeo's league mode which is a lot better and funner. I even go to arkadeo first before I go to my brute nowadays.</p>

I like him but he really needs first strike, he's always getting hurt early on unless I find another brute without first strike. Has HS/FA/LB with what I would say are decent weapons. I wish he only had halbard though. He also has tamer which helps him out often. Used to get many hammer/fierce brute 1 hit kills, but those are less common now.</p><br><p>St. Kill - <a href="http://mybrute.muxxu.com/fight/146402100?chk=acbc" target="_blank">http://mybrute.muxxu.com/fight/146402...</a><br>Second highest leveled brute, currently level 32. I believe he has the best build of my three brutes, with VIT/HS/FA (I'm not a fan of LB) as well as tamer, sabotage, and counter-attack. Currently I believe he just needs first strike, shield, and a few more of the better weapons. Trident is ok for now though.</p><br><p>St. Purity - <a href="http://mybrute.muxxu.com/fight/146402036?chk=f5d2" target="_blank">http://mybrute.muxxu.com/fight/146402...</a> My most recent brute, level 21 right now, he was very bad for awhile, I think he was level 16 when he finally won Padawan tournament. Of his first three Cheeky Slapper levels, he got axe and determination lol. I wanted to see how he would go from there, so I stuck with him. Very good agility brute now, along with sai and shuriken. Just needs his other stat boosters, along with counter-attack and first strike really.</p>
