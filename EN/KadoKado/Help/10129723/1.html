                Ever since MT stopped updating the site more than a year ago, it has become increasingly commonplace for veteran players to deactivate their accounts and start over from scratch.<br> <br> These accounts are easily recognizable: tons of <img src="http://www.kadokado.com/gfx/smileys/redStar.gif" alt=":etoile_rouge:">s, #1s in every other game, leveling up dozens of games at the same time, and most importantly, membership in an elite clan.<br> <br> Let's face it: no one gets into FISHERMAN, CSN, or another Tier 1 clan without at least a <img src="http://www.kadokado.com/gfx/smileys/small_level_2.gif" alt=":level2:"> (in most cases, several <img src="http://www.kadokado.com/gfx/smileys/small_level_1.gif" alt=":level1:">s, <img src="http://www.kadokado.com/gfx/smileys/small_level_0.gif" alt=":level0:">s and <em>records du site</em>.) The only reason these clans would let in a "newb," no matter how promising he looks, is that he's actually a restarted veteran player.<br> <br> <a target="_blank" href="/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kadokado.com%2Fuser%2F3476579">Case in point</a> (and <a target="_blank" href="/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Flueshi.info%2Fupload%2Fimages%2Fkk_restarted.jpg">screencap</a> for future reference.) Nobody scores 117.250 on Mini-Race as a first-time <img src="http://www.kadokado.com/gfx/smileys/small_level_7.gif" alt=":level7:">. Nobody.<br> <br> The problem with these players is that they become <em>extremely</em> disruptive at the upper ranks ( <img src="http://www.kadokado.com/gfx/smileys/small_level_2.gif" alt=":level2:">/<img src="http://www.kadokado.com/gfx/smileys/small_level_1.gif" alt=":level1:">/<img src="http://www.kadokado.com/gfx/smileys/small_level_0.gif" alt=":level0:"> ), and prevent honest players from making progress. They're also gaming the system to earn the one-time level-up <img src="http://www.kadokado.com/gfx/smileys/skpoint.gif" alt=":points_kado:">s over and over again, even though (strangely enough) M-T's rules do not explicitly forbid this.<br> <br> Look at <a target="_blank" href="/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kadokado.com%2Fuser%2F3442298">Jaws0</a>. He has a 624K Chakré Bouddha score in the <img src="http://www.kadokado.com/gfx/smileys/small_level_2.gif" alt=":level2:"> level, when the second highest is "only" 179K. It's highly unlikely that a first-time <img src="http://www.kadokado.com/gfx/smileys/small_level_2.gif" alt=":level2:"> level player can make a 600K score. Due to Chakré's low player turnout, only Jaws0 will advance to <img src="http://www.kadokado.com/gfx/smileys/small_level_1.gif" alt=":level1:"> at the end of this period. The honest players lose out and have to wait for the next period (assuming there's not another restarter waiting in line.)<br> <br> The restarters are all over the place. Rukawa's on at least his 3rd account; DragoTar is Gorbash reincarnate, etc. etc.<br> <br> So what should be done about this? M-T can either slam an iron fist and disable account closures altogether, or (if they're willing to lose a miniscule proportion of revenue) actually give rewards to the <img src="http://www.kadokado.com/gfx/smileys/small_level_0.gif" alt=":level0:"> players so they don't feel compelled to restart for extra <img src="http://www.kadokado.com/gfx/smileys/skpoint.gif" alt=":points_kado:">.<br> <br> My proposal would be something as simple as awarding 2000 <img src="http://www.kadokado.com/gfx/smileys/skpoint.gif" alt=":points_kado:"> for #1, 1000 <img src="http://www.kadokado.com/gfx/smileys/skpoint.gif" alt=":points_kado:"> for #2, and 500 <img src="http://www.kadokado.com/gfx/smileys/skpoint.gif" alt=":points_kado:"> #3. These prizes would be awarded at the end of every period, and only those who failed to win a prize from the featherweight championship would be eligible. M-T would lose no more than an additional 248.500<img src="http://www.kadokado.com/gfx/smileys/skpoint.gif" alt=":points_kado:"> (&lt; 50 EUR) per period, but there'd be a lot fewer restarters and the KK experience would be better for everyone.<br> <br> Just throwing some thoughts out there. I know M-T will likely ignore this and do nothing as usual, but I'm staying optimistic for now.

                Well, if I was in charge, this is how I would fix the level system:<br> <br> Currently, people level up based on position (and number of players at that level)...  Clearly this is unsustainable.  I would suggest using a "top players" average to set the goals for each level<br> <br> The average would literally be the average score of the top 20 people in <img src="http://www.kadokado.com/gfx/smileys/small_level_0.gif" alt=":level0:"> level.  Less than 20 people in there?  Pad the set of scores with a <img src="http://www.kadokado.com/gfx/smileys/greenStar.gif" alt=":etoile_verte:"> score<br> <br> Each level would have a certain percentage of that average as the barrier to entry.  I don't feel like posting a list of all my proposed values, but getting to <img src="http://www.kadokado.com/gfx/smileys/small_level_0.gif" alt=":level0:"> would require a score that's 150% of that average (getting to <img src="http://www.kadokado.com/gfx/smileys/small_level_7.gif" alt=":level7:"> would require 5%)<br> <br> A player cannot skip over levels if they get a really good score, and each level will have a hard limit on the number of level ups.  This way, games with a low amount of players can't get "stuck".  And yes, the cut off would still be based off of a players position in their level<br> <br> My idea could result in a <img src="http://www.kadokado.com/gfx/smileys/small_level_1.gif" alt=":level1:"> player not leveling up, even if they're #1...  but that's fine by me!  I would also allow 5 people to go up to <img src="http://www.kadokado.com/gfx/smileys/small_level_0.gif" alt=":level0:"> at once<br> <br> <br> This idea also makes it temporarily beneficial for a top player to restart.  By taking themselves out of the average, every level will be slightly easier to reach

                Well, saying you're right about the fact of being 'disruptive', which indeed it's just because of the lack of players, I'd like to say iGensis has the point when referring to re-starting players, quoting the fact of re-gaining <img src="http://www.kadokado.com/gfx/smileys/skpoint.gif" alt=":points_kado:"> kado-points in an endless way...<br> <br> Anyway, I actually think this is really an inherent failure of the site's system, where there's no reward but 'feathers' (?) gaining at the 0-level... I agree too about giving, at least, some <img src="http://www.kadokado.com/gfx/smileys/skpoint.gif" alt=":points_kado:"> kado-points at the last level in parallel to the 'featherweight championship', in order to make that the same as the other levels, and giving that motivation of earning <img src="http://www.kadokado.com/gfx/smileys/skpoint.gif" alt=":points_kado:"> for playing for the best at level 0, featherwight championship apart.<br> <br> About banning... <br> <br> Well, I really can't say that banning is the smartest way for fixing this "failure", in fact, I could consider myself a 're-starter', since I really had two accounts...<br> <br> First one -#1933012- I deleted it, since I didn't feel that long of being a <strong><em>Rose-VIP 3-clan player</em></strong>, and now I stayed with this one, which I used to, and created someday back, as an 'trainning account', and an "enjoy for myself" account, just sometime after I joined a clan here... Just felt confortable by playing by myself, by my rythm, and whenever I felt to...<br> <br> But... yap, you can earn kado-points (money-back, in another way) endlessly if you're really a good player at here... (I am not, unfortunatelly...)<br> <br> Me? (hahaha) I just spent almost about 3 entire years to gain 30.000 pts (!!) at playing only the 4 daily <img src="http://www.kadokado.com/gfx/smileys/ggem.gif" alt=":gemme_verte:"> green gems...

                <cite>I don't really see how these players are being so "disruptive".<br> <br> Trying to find ways to restrict people from starting over really makes no sense...</cite><br> Do you just like to play devil's advocate or are you so stubborn as to think that this site is perfect as is, and that M-T could do no wrong?<br> <br> I swear, it's the same deal with the French mods. After I posted criticisms about the luck-based nature of the games and wasted <img src="http://www.kadokado.com/gfx/smileys/rgem.gif" alt=":gemme_orange:">s, they responded with "It's part of the charm of the site."<br> <br> If you read the paragraph below the one you quoted, I explain exactly what's so disruptive about these restarting players. I'll post another example just in case:<br> <br> Once upon a time, there was a French player named jojo1er, who was really really good/lucky/patient/etc. at Hypercube. He made it all the way to heaven <img src="http://www.kadokado.com/gfx/smileys/small_level_0.gif" alt=":level0:"> .<br> <br> Then he deleted his account and restarted as nightm4n. nightm4n eventually made a world record score of 3.408.000 pts.<br> <br> In Period 73, a talented <img src="http://www.kadokado.com/gfx/smileys/small_level_1.gif" alt=":level1:"> player made an unbelievable score of 939.200. Then nightm4n waited until the 13th/14th day of the period and beat him by 100 points, the smallest score increment in Hypercube. An honest player and his 2 hour+ game just went down the drain.<br> <br> Hypercube is currently the 3rd <em>least</em> popular puzzle game. On most periods, the top 3 levels only has 1-2 advancers each.<br> <br> And after reaching <img src="http://www.kadokado.com/gfx/smileys/small_level_0.gif" alt=":level0:">, nightm4n deleted his account again...<br> <br> So in at least 6 out of 16 periods, an honest Hypercube player in the top 3 levels was barred from advancing thanks to jojo1er. Now, it's great that someone has gotten so good/lucky at this one game, but he shouldn't be allowed to level up over and over again <em>at the expense of others</em>. <br> <br> Plus, M-T loses revenue for this. A restarted FISHERMAN member who regains a few dozen metallic trophies can easily cost M-T upwards of 100 Euros from the repeat level-up <img src="http://www.kadokado.com/gfx/smileys/skpoint.gif" alt=":points_kado:">s they earn. Doesn't M-T care about money more than anything else? <br> <br> Bottom line is, if M-T spared a few extra Euros every period and awarded prizes to the non-featherweight <img src="http://www.kadokado.com/gfx/smileys/small_level_0.gif" alt=":level0:"> players, this controversy wouldn't be happening.<br> <br> <cite>In fact, they may actually be useful in helping people level up in the lower ranks of unpopular games. <img src="http://www.kadokado.com/gfx/smileys/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P"></cite><br> It's highly unlikely. At the <img src="http://www.kadokado.com/gfx/smileys/small_level_8.gif" alt=":level8:"> level it takes 33/34 additional players to produce 10 additional advancers <img src="http://www.kadokado.com/gfx/smileys/small_level_7.gif" alt=":level7:">. Let's say that 3 restarted players boosted the player count from 99 to 102 (and consequently the advancer count from 30 to 40.) Those restarted players will take up 3 advancer slots and add room for 7 other advancers. Probability of this happening: slim to none. At the higher levels, only the restarted players benefit while everyone else is negatively affected.

This is especially true for the games that (a) are extremely luck-based, (b) use exponential scoring (think Alchimie), and/or (c) have fewer active players.

I know it's not a serious benefit, but you can't really claim that restarters provide no benefit.<br> <br> <cite>Keep in mind that M-T has all the historical ranking/placement data since Period 66, but they never bothered to use it for determining star cutoffs.</cite><br> With perhaps a few exceptions, this is flat out false.
